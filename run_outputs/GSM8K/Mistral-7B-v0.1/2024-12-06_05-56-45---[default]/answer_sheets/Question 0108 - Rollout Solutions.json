Henry planned to bake twice as many cookies as last year. But in the end, he baked 15 more cookies than he meant to. And when he was done, he had 110 cookies in total. Let's first find out how many cookies he made last year. Since he wanted to make twice as many as last year, he must have made 110 / 2 = 55. Then, let's find out how many cookies he baked this year that were extra. He baked 15 more than he wanted. So he baked 110 - 95 = 15. To find the number of cookies he made last year, we subtract the number of extra cookies he baked from the total number of cookies. That means 55 (how many cookies he made last year) - 15 (the number of extra cookies he baked this year) is the number of cookies he made last year.

Henry started by wanting to make twice as many cookies as last year. That would mean 2 times as many cookies. So Henry wanted to make [last year's amount] x 2 = 2 times as many cookies.\n\nBut Henry actually baked 15 more than he intended to. So if he intended to bake twice as many as last year, he actually baked [last year's amount] x 2 + 15.\n\nAfter dropping 5, he had 110 left. If he had 110 cookies, then it means we can say ([last year's amount] x 2 + 15) - 5 = 110.\n\nSince we want to find last year's amount, let's solve for that. We'll rewrite the equation as 2[last year's amount] + 15 - 5 = 110. So (2[last year's amount]) + 10 = 110. Then we can subtract 10 from both sides, so 2[last year's amount] = 100.
