Henry started by wanting to make twice as many cookies as last year. That would mean 2 times as many cookies. So Henry wanted to make [last year's amount] x 2 = 2 times as many cookies.\n\nBut Henry actually baked 15 more than he intended to. So if he intended to bake twice as many as last year, he actually baked [last year's amount] x 2 + 15.\n\nAfter dropping 5, he had 110 left. If he had 110 cookies, then it means we can say ([last year's amount] x 2 + 15) - 5 = 110.\n\nSince we want to find last year's amount, let's solve for that. We'll rewrite the equation as 2[last year's amount] + 15 - 5 = 110. So (2[last year's amount]) + 10 = 110. Then we can subtract 10 from both sides, so 2[last year's amount] = 100.
