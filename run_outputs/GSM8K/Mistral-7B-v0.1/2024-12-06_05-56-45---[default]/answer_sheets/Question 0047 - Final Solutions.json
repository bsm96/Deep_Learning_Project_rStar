Let's take that number and multiply it by 2 to get the number of red ties. 5 x 2 = 10; thus, John bought 10 red ties. Because the price of a blue tie is known and John purchased twice as many red ties as blue ties, let's find the price of a red tie. (50% more) \u00d7 40 = 60; so, each red tie costs $60.

That means the price of one red tie is 50% greater than the price of one blue tie. We know that the price of one blue tie is $40. Thus, the price of one red tie is 50% * $40 = $60. Since John bought 10 red ties, he spent 10 * $60 = $600 on red ties. And since he already spent $200 on blue ties, the grand total is $600 + $200 = $800.
