First, we can look at the costs of the various items that John purchased. According to the problem statement, milk costs 2 dollars, eggs cost 3 dollars, light bulbs cost 3 dollars, cups cost 3 dollars, and roach traps cost 4 dollars. To calculate the total cost of these items, including tax, we can multiply the cost of each item by 1.1. This represents a 10% increase due to taxation. The resulting calculations are as follows: milk: 2 * 1.1 = 2.2 eggs: 3 * 1.1 = 3.3 light bulbs: 3 * 1.1 = 3.3 cups: 3 * 1.1 = 3.3 roach traps: 4 * 1.1 = 4.4 Thus, the total cost of the items purchased by John is equal to the sum of these values, which amounts to 2.2 + 3.3 + 3.3 + 3.3 + 4.4 = 16.6.
