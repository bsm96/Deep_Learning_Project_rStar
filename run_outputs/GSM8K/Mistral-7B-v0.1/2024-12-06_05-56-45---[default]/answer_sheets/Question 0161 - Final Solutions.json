From this point, we want to know how many fish Locsin caught. In the second condition, it says Locsin caught fewer fish than Anakin. So let's subtract 5 from all three values to represent Locsin's catch: 5 starfish, 5 sea horses, and 1 clownfish. These are still less than Anakin's catch because these values don't add up to 19. In the third condition, it says Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish, 3 fewer sea horses, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. Let's take away 5 from starfish, 3 from sea horses, and add 2 to clownfish. We get 0 starfish, 3 sea horses, and 5 clownfish. These are still less than Anakin's catch because they don't add up to 19.
