Condition 2 says that when the number of Brian's games decreases by 5, Bobby now has 5 fewer than Brian does. So this means (x - 5 - 5) = 5 - (x - 5). We rewrite as (x - 5 - 5) + 5 = x - 5, so x - 10 = x - 5, which implies 5 = x. Since 5 is Brian's number of games, this makes sense. Finally, condition 3 says that after losing 5 games, Brian still has twice as many games as Bobby. From above, we know 5 is Brian's number of games, and if 5 decreased by 5, then 5 - 5 would be zero. Zero times twice is zero, and so we get zero is equal to Bobby's number of games. This doesn't make sense because we know Bobby must have at least one game. So the only condition that makes sense is to have 5 as Brian's original number of games. The answer is: 5.", "value": 0.28125}}}, "rollout_id": 3}]
