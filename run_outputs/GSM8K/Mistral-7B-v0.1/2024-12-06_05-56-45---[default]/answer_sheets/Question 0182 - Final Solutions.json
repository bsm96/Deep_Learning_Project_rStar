We know Mark's age two years ago because we are told that he was five years older than half Jan's age two years ago. So we can say that Jean's age two years ago was 4 + 5 = 9.

We know that Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age two years ago. So if we add 5 to the value of half Jan's age two years ago, we get Mark's age two years ago. We already calculated this value above as 9. So we know that half Jan's age two years ago was 9 - 5 = 4. Finally, we can calculate Jan's age today.

We know that Mark is two years older than Jean, so if we add two years to their ages, Mark will still be one year older than Jean. This means that their ages will remain unchanged but their difference will be increased by two. Now let's look at the second part of the question: two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jean's age. This means that 5 years ago Mark's age was half Jean's age plus five. Now we need to figure out what Jean's age was 5 years ago. To do this, we can use the equation: Jean's age 5 years ago + 5 = half Jean's age. Solving for Jean's age, we get: Jean's age 5 years ago = (half Jean's age) - 5. Now we can plug this into the previous equation and solve for Mark's age: Mark's age 5 years ago = half Jean's age + 5. Now we can plug these values into the original statement: 2 years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. This means that 5 years ago Mark's age was half Jean's age plus five. Subtracting two years from both sides, we get: 3 years ago Mark's age was half Jean's age plus three. Now we can solve for Mark's age: Mark's age 3 years ago = (half Jean's age) - 3. Finally, we can plug this value into the original statement: Jean is two years older than Mark. This means that 3 years ago, Jean's age was two years older than Mark's age, or (half Jean's age) + 1. Now we can solve for Jean's age: Jean's age 3 years ago = (half Jean's age) - 1. Plugging this value into the earlier equation, we get: Jean's age 5 years ago = (half Jean's age) - 6. Now we can subtract the difference between Jean's age 5 years ago and her age 3 years ago, which is 2 years, from both sides: Jean's age 5 years ago - Jean's age 3 years ago = (half Jean's age) - 6 - (half Jean's age) + 1. Simplifying, we get: 4 = (half Jean's age). Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 2 = half Jean's age. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 4 = Jean's age.
