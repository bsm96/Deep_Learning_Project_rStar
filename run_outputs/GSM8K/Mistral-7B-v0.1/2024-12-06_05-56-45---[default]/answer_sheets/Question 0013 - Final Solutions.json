Finally, she sold half of what was left. Since we already know what was sold at the red house, we can calculate how much was left before it was sold. We know that she sold Y vacuum cleaners, but not all of them. To find out how much was left, we need to subtract Y from X. And since she sold half of that amount at the orange house, we divide that amount by two. Putting it all together, the answer is X minus Y, divided by two. So if Melanie sold 5 vacuum cleaners, let's solve for X. X equals 5 plus Y, divided by two. Substitute Y with its value. X equals 5 plus X divided by three, divided by two. Multiply both sides of the equation by 6 to cancel out divisions. 6 times X equals 15 plus 6 times X divided by three.

First, we know that Melanie started with a certain amount of vacuum cleaners. Let's call it X. X divided into three equals the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the green house. X divided into two plus two more equals the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the red house. And X divided into half plus the other half of those vacuum cleaners equals the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the orange house. So, let's take the equation of X divided into three, which is equal to the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the green house. That will equal five, because the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the green house is equal to five. Next, let's take the equation of X divided into two plus two more, which will also equal five. Finally, let's take the equation of X divided into half plus the other half of those vacuum cleaners. This will also equal five, since the number of vacuum cleaners she sold at the orange house equals five. So, if we add all these equations together, we get X plus X plus X. Therefore, the total amount of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with is three times the number of vacuum cleaners she started with, plus three times the number of vacuum cleaners she started with, plus three times the number of vacuum cleaners she started with. So, the total amount of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with is nine times the number of vacuum cleaners she started with. Since we know Melanie ended up with five vacuum cleaners, we can rewrite the equation as follows: 9X = 5. Dividing both sides of the equation by 9, we get X = 5/9.

Adding these all up, we get X - 2 + 0.5 * (X - 2) = 5 vacuum cleaners left. Rearranging terms gives us: X = 2.

We know Melanie had five left, so if we plug that into our equation, it would look like this: One out of three is equal to five. 1/3 = 5. Now we can figure out how many Melanie had to begin with. We can start with the equation again, but this time let's replace one third with the original amount: Melanie had one third plus all the others that she didn't sell yet. 1/3 + X = 5 (X being the amount she hadn't sold).
