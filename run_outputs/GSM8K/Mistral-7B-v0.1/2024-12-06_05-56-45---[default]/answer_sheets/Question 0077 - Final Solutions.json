And from the second condition we know that Sarah does four times as much laundry as David. Let's call Sarah's amount of laundry Y. Then David's amount of laundry is Y/4. To find out Raymond's amount of laundry, we take Sarah's amount divided by 2, which would be Y/2. To find out the difference, we subtract Raymond's amount of laundry from David's amount of laundry. That would be Y/4 - (Y/2) = (Y/4) - (Y/2). By multiplying top and bottom of right hand side by 2, we get Y/8 - Y/4 = Y/8 + Y/8. Since Y equals 400, we can substitute it into our equation to get 400/8 - 400/4 = 400/8 + 400/8. Simplifying this gives us 50 - 100 = 50 + 50.

Since the sum of everyone's work equals 400, we can say that Raymond's share of the work is 400/2 = 200 pounds, while Sarah's share is 400/4 = 100 pounds. David's share is then calculated by subtracting the other two shares from 400: 400 - (200+100) = 100.

We know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Sarah does four times as much laundry as David. Sarah completes 400 pounds of laundry in total. Since Sarah does four times as much as David, David does 25% as much as Sarah. That means David does 1/4 as much as Sarah. Next, since Sarah completes 400 pounds in total, we can divide by 4 to find out how much Sarah completes in one day. This is because there are 4 days in a week. We get that Sarah completes 100 pounds of laundry per day. We also know that Raymond does half as much as Sarah. So he completes only 50 pounds per day. Finally, we want to know the difference between Raymond and David. To calculate this, we first subtract the amount of laundry Raymond completes from the amount Sarah completes. Sarah completes 100 pounds, so Raymond completes 50. The difference is 50. We don't need to finish this calculation, since the question is asking about Raymond and David, not just David.
