First, let's figure out how much each can of tomatoes loses as sauce. 16 / 2 = 8, so it loses 8/3 (= 2 2/3) tomatoes per can. So, if we want 32 oz of sauce, we need 32 * (m/3) tomatoes. That gives us the equation 16m / 3 = 32 * (m/3). Multiplying both sides by 3, we get 16m = 96. Dividing both sides by 16, we get m = 6. Therefore, Freda used 6 tomatoes.
