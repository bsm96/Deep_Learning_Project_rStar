First, we need to figure out how long it takes for the fog bank to roll through 3 miles of the city. From the hint, we know that takes 10 minutes. To figure out how long it would take to go through all 42 miles, you can think of it like this. You could say if it took 1 minute to cross one mile, it would take 42 minutes. Since it takes 10 minutes for 3 miles, it would take 42 minutes for 42 miles, so 42/3 times longer. 42/3 is 14, so 14 times longer than for one mile.

From the oceanfront to the other edge is 42 miles. Every three miles it covers in 10 minutes. So in order to cover the entire length, it must take 42 / 3 = 14 times ten minutes. Ten minutes is one sixth of an hour, so one ten minute interval would be one sixth of an hour or 1/6 hours. To convert this to a fraction of an hour, multiply by 60. This means that 1/6 hours becomes 60/6 which is 10 minutes. Since we already converted, we can just multiply 10 minutes by 14. That is 10 * 14 = 140 minutes.
