Condition 1: 1 pound of beeswax allows Charlie to produce 10 tapered candles. Condition 2: Each pound of beeswax and its accompanying wick costs him $10.00 in supplies. Condition 3: Charlie sells each candle for $2.00 apiece. Condition 4: He plans to make and sell 20 candles. Question: What is his overall profit from this endeavor?", "ost_step": {"1": "Firstly, determine the amount of beeswax needed. Each tapered candle requires 1/10th of a pound of beeswax. Charlie plans to make and sell 20 candles, so he needs 20/10 = 2 pounds of beeswax.", "2": "Next, determine the cost of the wax and wicks. Since 1 pound of beeswax costs $10, and Charlie needs 2 pounds, the total cost for the wax and wicks is $10 x 2 = $20."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Charlie plans to make and sell 20 candles. That means he needs 20/10ths of a pound of beeswax which is 2 pounds. One pound of beeswax costs $10. So Charlie needs 2 x $10 = $20 for the wax and wicks. He sells each candle for $2. So he made a total of 20 * $2 = $40 from selling candles. And he spent $20 for making them. So his overall profit is $40 - $20 = $20.
