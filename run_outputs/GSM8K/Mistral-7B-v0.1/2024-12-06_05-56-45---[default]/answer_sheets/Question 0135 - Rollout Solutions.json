Condition 1:  Before losing 5 video games, Brian has twice as many games as his friend Bobby. Condition 2: When the number of Brian's games decreases by 5, Bobby now has 5 fewer than Brian does. Condition 3: After losing 5 games, Brian still has twice as many games as Bobby. Question: How many video games does Bobby have now?", "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Condition 1 says that initially Brian has twice as many games as Bobby. So we can set it up as (x - 5) = 2(y), where x is Brian's number of games and y is Bobby's. Condition 2 says that when the number of Brian's games decreases by 5, Bobby now has 5 fewer than Brian does. So this means (x - 5 - 5) = 5 - (x - 5). We rewrite as (x - 5 - 5) + 5 = x - 5, so x - 10 = x - 5, which implies 5 = x. Since 5 is Brian's number of games, this makes sense. Finally, condition 3 says that after losing 5 games, Brian still has twice as many games as Bobby. From above, we know 5 is Brian's number of games, and if 5 decreased by 5, then 5 - 5 would be zero. Zero times twice is zero, and so we get zero is equal to Bobby's number of games. This doesn't make sense because we know Bobby must have at least one game. So the only condition that makes sense is to have 5 as Brian's original number of games.
