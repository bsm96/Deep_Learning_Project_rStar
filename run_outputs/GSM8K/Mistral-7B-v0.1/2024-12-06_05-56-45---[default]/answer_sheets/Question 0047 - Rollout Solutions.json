He also bought twice as many red ties. Let's call them r red ties. So if John paid $200, the price of one red tie must be 200 / (2r) dollars. That price is 50% higher than for blue ties. So we get 200 / (2r) = 40 * 1.5 = 60. Solving this equation, r = 1. We found that John bought 10 red ties. It costs 60 dollars per red tie, so 10 times 60 = 600.

According to the question, John spends $200 on blue ties, which cost $40 per piece. Let's use this information to determine the quantity of blue ties purchased. $200 \u00f7 $40 = 5; therefore, John purchased 5 blue ties. Let's take that number and multiply it by 2 to get the number of red ties. 5 x 2 = 10; thus, John bought 10 red ties. Because the price of a blue tie is known and John purchased twice as many red ties as blue ties, let's find the price of a red tie. (50% more) \u00d7 40 = 60; so, each red tie costs $60.
