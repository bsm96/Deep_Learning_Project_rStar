Kim has three clients now. If he adds five more, he will have eight clients. Every client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths. That means Lucas will need 2 x 8 = 16 bottles of bleach and 8 times the price of a pack of cloths = 8 x 5 = 40. Lucas also needs to buy these bottles and cloths.
