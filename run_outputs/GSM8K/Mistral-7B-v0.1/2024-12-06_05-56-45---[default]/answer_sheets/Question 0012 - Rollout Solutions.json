First we calculate how much Carlos would earn with the lemon tree. He would get 7 lemons a year. They sell for $1.5 each so in total he gets $1.5 x 7 = $10.5 a year. But he needs to spend $3 a year for water and food. So it is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5. We need to figure out when it becomes positive. $7.5 times how ever many years it takes will equal $90. So (7.5 * y) = 90. Divide both sides by 7.5 to isolate y. y = (90 / 7.5) = 12. So it will take 12 years before he starts making money.
