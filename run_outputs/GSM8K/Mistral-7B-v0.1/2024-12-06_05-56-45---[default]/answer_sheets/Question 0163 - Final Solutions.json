Each toy has a certain value, but we don't know it yet. We know that one red car costs $4 and one action figure costs $5.

This information can be used to calculate what a single red car and a single action figure cost. 5 red cars cost 5 x 4 = 20, so a single red car costs 20 / 5 = 4. 3 action figures cost 3 x 5 = 15, so a single action figure costs 15 / 3 = 5. Let's suppose the price of the doll is d, so the total cost of all toys is 5 x 4 + 3 x 5 + d. Since this is the sum of prices of all toys, it equals the total cost of all toys. 5 x 4 + 3 x 5 + d = 20 + 15 + d. Rearranging this, we get 5 x 4 + 3 x 5 + d - 20 - 15 - d = 0.
