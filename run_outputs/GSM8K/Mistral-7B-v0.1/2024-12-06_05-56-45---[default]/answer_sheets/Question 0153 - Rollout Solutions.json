Each pigeon ate 3 french fries each. That is 3 * 3 = 9 french fries. The raccoon took two thirds, so that means 2/3 of the rest. If we call the rest x, then 2x is two thirds of x, or 2/3 of x. We can multiply both sides of the equation to get rid of the fraction. 2x = 2/3 * x. This means that 2/3 * x equals x / 3. So x divided by 3 is 2. So there were 2 french fries remaining after the pigeons ate them. Finally, the ants carried off one french fry. So the pack contained 14 - 7 + 9 + 2 - 1 = 14.

Now, when the seagull left, there were 14 - (y / 2) french fries. 14 - (y / 2) french fries was divided equally into three parts for each pigeon to eat. Each pigeon ate (14 - (y / 2)) / 3 french fries. Now, there were 14 - (y / 2) - 3x french fries. Of these french fries, 2/3 of them were stolen by the raccoon. That means 14 - (y / 2) - 3x - (2/3)(14 - (y / 2) - 3x) french fries remained. Finally, one ant took one french fry, so there were only 14 - (y / 2) - 3x - (2/3)(14 - (y / 2) - 3x) - 1 french fries left, and since this equals 5, we can solve for y to get that y=6.

So this leaves 7 - 9 = -2 fries. Luckily, we can round to 0 here. And a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, or 2/3 * 0 = 0. Finally, ants carry off one fry, leaving 1 fry.
