The 20 available cars for rent can be divided into three categories. One is the automatic car category. It has 12 cars. Another one is the manual car category. It also has 4 cars. So there should be (20 - 12 - 4) = 4 cars in the last category, which are semi-automatic cars. We know there are 4 semi-automatic cars. The number of total cars is 20. Divide 4 by 20 to get the percentage of semi-automatic cars. 4 / 20 is 0.2. Multiply 0.2 by 100 to convert it to a percent. 0.2 x 100 is 20%. So 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.
