It means if Seattle has m sheep, Charleston has 4m sheep. According to the third condition, Seattle has 20 sheep. To find the total number of sheep, we can use a systematic approach. We know that Toulouse has 2n sheep, where n is the number of sheep that Charleston has. We also know that Charleston has 4m sheep, where m is the number of sheep that Seattle has. Now, let's apply these values to the equation. We have Toulouse: 2n Charleston: 4m Seattle: 20 The total number of sheep is: 2n + 4m + 20. Now, to determine the values of n and m, we can use the last condition, which states that Seattle has 20 sheep. This means that m is equal to 20. Plugging this into the equation, we get: 2n + 4(20) + 20 = 2n + 80 + 20 = 2n + 100. Finally, we can solve for n using algebra: 2n + 100 = 260 2n = 260 - 100 2n = 160 n = 80 Therefore, the total number of sheep among Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is: 2x80 + 4x20 + 20 = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260.
