We want to find out the size of the sandcastle levels. When you divide a rectangle into half, its width remains unchanged, but its length halves. So the first layer of the sand castle has a base area of SQFT. Then when you halve it again, it becomes 1/4th the original, or SQFT/4. That keeps going down. 1/8, 1/16, etc. In general, each new level gets smaller by a factor of 1/2. So the second level has an area of SQFT/2. The third has area SQFT/4, fourth has area SQFT/8, etc. Each new layer gets 1/2 the area of the previous layer. This means that the whole sand castle has an area equal to the sum of all of these areas. It works out like this:\nSQFT/2 + SQFT/4 + SQFT/8 + ...\nWe can simplify this using fractions:\n1/2 * (SQFT/2 + SQFT/4 + SQFT/8 + ...)\nHere we see that all the numbers in the brackets are getting divisible by 2. So we can just multiply by one more power of 2 and it doesn't change the value inside the parentheses:\n(1/2)(SQFT/2 + SQFT/4 + SQFT/8 + ...) = SQFT/2\nSo the total area of the entire sand castle is equal to the area of the bottom layer, SQFT/2.", "value": 0.4}, "ost_step": {}}, "2": {"subquestion": "Now we can answer the question: What is the average square footage of a level?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's take a look at the area of the different layers of the sand castle. First level: SQFT Second level: SQFT/2 Third level: SQFT/4 Fourth level: SQFT/8 Etc. Each layer is 1/2 the area of the previous layer. The average square footage is the sum of all these areas divided by the number of levels. If we sum up all the areas, we get SQFT + SQFT/2 + SQFT/4 + SQFT/8 + SQFT/16 + SQFT/32 + ... This series can be simplified to SQFT/2 because every term gets divided by two each time. And there are infinite terms in this series.
