First, let's identify what is given and what we need to find. We know there are 25 oranges in total. Of these, one is bad, 20% are unripe, 2 are sour, and the rest are good. Our job is to determine how many oranges are good. Now, let's use our knowledge of percentages to solve this problem. Since 20% of the oranges are unripe, we can set up a proportion to find how many oranges are unripe. We know that (unripe)/(total) = 20%, so (unripe)/25 = 20%. Multiplying both sides by 25 gives us 5 oranges are unripe. Similarly, since 8% of the oranges are sour, we can set up another proportion to find how many oranges are sour. We know that (sour)/(total) = 8%, so (sour)/25 = 8%. Multiplying both sides by 25 gives us 2 oranges are sour. Finally, since there are 25 oranges in total, and we already found that 1 is bad, 5 are unripe, and 2 are sour, that leaves 17 oranges that must be good.
