We know that the alarm rang for four times the first time, three times the second time and half as long the third time. That means the first time was twice the third time. The second time was four times the third time. The third time was half the fourth time. Let's call the lengths t1, t2, t3, and t4. Therefore we have the following equations:\nt2 = 4 * t3\nt3 = 0.5 * t4\nt1 = 2 * t3\nMultiplying the top equation by 2 and adding to the middle one yields\nt2 + 2 * t3 = 2 * t3 + 4 * t3\nand multiplying by 2 again yields\nt2 + 4 * t3 = 8 * t3\nNow dividing both sides by t3 yields\nt2 / t3 + 4 = 8\nSince the third time was the shortest (smallest) length, we can use t3 = 1 to simplify this further:\nt2 / t3 + 4 = 8\nor\nt2 / t3 = 8 - 4 = 4\nThen t2 = t3 * 4 = 1 * 4 = 4\nSo the alarm rang for 4 times the first time.
