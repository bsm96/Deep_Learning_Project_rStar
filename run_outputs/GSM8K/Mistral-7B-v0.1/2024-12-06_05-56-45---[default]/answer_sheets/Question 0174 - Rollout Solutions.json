We know that it takes around a minute and a half to peel a potato, and around 5 seconds to cut it up.

To find out how long it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes, we just need to multiply this amount of time by the number of potatoes he has to prepare. 60 potatoes times 1.5 minutes per potato equals 90 minutes, which can be written as 1 hour and 30 minutes.
