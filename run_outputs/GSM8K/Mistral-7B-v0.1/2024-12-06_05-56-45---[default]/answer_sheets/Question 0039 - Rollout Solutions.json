Condition 1: 1 mile per hour = 60 minutes. Condition 2: Dana runs at 4 times the speed of her walking pace. Condition 3: Skipping happens at half the speed of her running. Condition 4: Dana skips at a rate of 3 miles per hour. Condition 5: In six hours, she runs one-third of the time and walks two-thirds of the time. Question: What is the distance covered during this time?", "ost_step": {}}, "1": {"subquestion": "When skipping, how fast does Dana move?", "subanswer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. To figure out the answer, we need to apply all the rules that we know about running and skipping. Condition 1 says that 1 mile per hour takes 60 minutes. Condition 2 says that Dana can run at 4 times her walking speed. Let's call this running speed R and her walking speed W. That means R = 4W. Condition 3 says that skipping happens at half the speed of running. So let's call the speed when skipping S. That means S = 0.5R or S = 2W. Condition 4 says that Dana skips at a rate of 3 miles per hour. Since 1 mile per hour is equal to 60 minutes, 3 miles per hour is 3 x 60 = 180 minutes. But remember, we have already determined that S = 2W. We can rewrite the equation as S = 2(180/60)W. This equals to S = 6W. Condition 5 says that Dana runs one third of the time and walks two thirds of the time. In six hours, this means that she ran for two hours (one third of six) and walked four hours (two thirds of six). Also remember that running speed is 4 times her walking speed. So she ran for 8W miles, while she walked for 12W miles. This means that after six hours of running and skipping, she covered 8W + 12W miles, which is equal to 20W miles. This also tells us that she walked for 12W miles in six hours. We already knew that skipping happens at half the speed of running. So when she skips for 12W miles, it is actually the same as if she ran for 24W miles. This means that she ran for 24W miles in six hours. Since she was running for two hours, it means that she ran at 24W / 2 = 12W miles per hour.

W = 3 / 2 miles per hour. One third of the time running means three times running time. Two thirds of the time walking means two times walking time. Three times running time plus two times walking time is six hours. Running time is 1 mile per hour. Walking time is 1/2 miles per hour. Running distance is R*3. Walking distance is W*2.
