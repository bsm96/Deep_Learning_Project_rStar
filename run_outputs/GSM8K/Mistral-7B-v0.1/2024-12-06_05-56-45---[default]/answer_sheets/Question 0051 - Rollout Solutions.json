Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour. Let's say from 1 PM to 4 PM he travelled at 10 mph. This means he travelled 3 hours and travelled 30 miles. From 4 PM to 7 PM he travelled 6 mph. 6 mph for 3 hours is another 18 miles travelled. 30 + 18 = 48 miles travelled. At this point, he is back at point A.

First we need to find out how fast Tom goes to the point and then back again. The way back starts at 4 pm, so we'll subtract three hours from that. Tom travels at 10 mph on the way over. The other direction is 6 mph. Therefore 4 - 3 = 1 pm. So Tom went from 1 to 4 pm. That's three hours. Tom traveled at 10 mph. So he travelled 30 miles. To get back, he went at 6 mph.
