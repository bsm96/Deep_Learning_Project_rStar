We start with Jamal's photo of ducks. This is not very helpful yet. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. So let's work from Brittany's phone. Let's call that number X. X is the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold. That means that 50 times more than X would be 50X. That is the maximum number of photographs that Jamal's phone could hold if the number of ducks was zero. If the number of ducks is higher than zero, then it would make the number of photographs that Jamal's phone can hold smaller.\nSo let's figure out how high the number of ducks could possibly go. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone, but Jamal's phone cannot hold 50X. So we can figure out how many ducks would result in Jamal's phone holding 50X photographs. That would be 50X / 6 because we know that 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone would equal 50X. 6 times less than 50X is 50X / 6. So that is the max number of ducks that we are looking for. It will give us the highest possible number of photographs that Jamal's phone can hold.

The problem says it is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photo of ducks at the zoo. So let's say that the maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can hold is n. This means 50n is the number of birds in Jamal's photo. We also know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than can Brittany's phone. So if Brittany's phone holds n photos, then Jamal's phone would hold 6n photos. Since we already know that Jamal's phone holds 1800 photos, we can substitute 6n for 1800. So 1800 = 6n. Dividing both sides by 6, we get 300 = n. Therefore, the maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can hold is 300.\n\nNow that we know the maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can hold, we need to find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. The problem states that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo. So let's say that the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is y. This means 50y is the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold.
