The merchant can buy either $5000 jewelry or $8000 electronics. These are the two options we need to compare. Secondly, we need the prices for each option. The jewelry is priced at $5000. Electronics are priced at $8000. Next, we calculate what these options will cost after they are increased by their respective percentage increases. For the jewelry, we use the formula price_increased = price * (1 + % increase). This means 5000 * (1 + .025), or 5000 * 1.025. This equals 5000 * 1.025, or 5125. For the electronics, we use the formula price_increased = price * (1 + % increase). This means 8000 * (1 + .012), or 8000 * 1.012. This equals 8000 * 1.012, or 8096. This is the last calculation needed to find the difference in the increased values of the two options. The jewelry option increased from 5000 to 5125. This leaves a difference of 5125 - 5000, or 125. The electronics option increased from 8000 to 8096. This leaves a difference of 8096 - 8000, or 96.
