One article takes 4 hours to write, so this answer is 4.\n\nOn Monday, she wrote 5 articles, which took her 5 x 4 = 20 hours to finish.\n\nTuesday she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. This means she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 4 more articles than on Monday. So she ended up writing 5 + 4 = 9 articles on Tuesday. These took her 9 x 4 = 36 hours to complete.\n\nAnd lastly on Wednesday, she wrote twice the amount of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This was 2 times 9 = 18 more articles than on Tuesday, meaning she wrote 27 articles on Wednesday. The 27 articles took her 27 x 4 = 108 hours to finish.\n\nSo overall, Meredith spent 20 + 36 + 108 = 164 hours writing articles in those 3 days.
