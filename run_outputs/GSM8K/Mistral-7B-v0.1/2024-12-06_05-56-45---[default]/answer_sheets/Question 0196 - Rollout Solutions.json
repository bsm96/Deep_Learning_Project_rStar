First, we must determine how many pounds of carrots are required for distribution to all 40 restaurants. This can be calculated by multiplying the number of restaurants by the amount of carrots each one receives. Since each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, the equation is 40 x 2 = 80. Thus, 80 pounds of carrots are needed to distribute to all 40 restaurants. However, it's important to note that this doesn't take into account any extra or leftover carrots. To calculate the number of leftover carrots, we simply subtract the amount of carrots needed (80) from the total weight of carrots available (200).
