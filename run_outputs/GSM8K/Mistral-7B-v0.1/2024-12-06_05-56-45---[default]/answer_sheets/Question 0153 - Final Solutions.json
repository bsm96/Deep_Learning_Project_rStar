So this leaves 7 - 9 = -2 fries. Luckily, we can round to 0 here. And a raccoon stole 2/3 of the remaining fries, or 2/3 * 0 = 0. Finally, ants carry off one fry, leaving 1 fry.

First, Dave ate fourteen before the seagull arrived, so x - 14 french fries remained. After the seagull arrived, he took half of those, or (x \u2013 14) / 2, french fries. That means x \u2013 14 was divided into halves, which left (x \u2013 14) / 2 french fries left in the pack. Then the pigeons arrived, each taking three fries, so that left ((x \u2013 14) / 2) / 3. Then, the raccoon took two thirds of the rest, or two thirds of ((x \u2013 14) / 2) / 3, which leaves us with (((((x \u2013 14) / 2) / 3) * 2 / 3) / 5). Finally, the ants leave one left over, which means (((((((x \u2013 14) / 2) / 3) * 2 / 3) / 5) \u2013 1). This is quite a complicated fraction! Let\u2019s simplify this by multiplying both sides of this equation by 20: 20(((((((x \u2013 14) / 2) / 3) * 2 / 3) / 5) \u2013 1) = 20(((x \u2013 14) / 2) / 3) * 2 / 3) / 5) \u2013 1). Then we can cancel 5 on the right side and get 4(((x \u2013 14) / 2) / 3) * 2 / 3) = 4(((x \u2013 14) / 2) / 3) * 2 / 3) \u2013 1.

We can multiply both sides of the equation to get rid of the fraction. 2x = 2/3 * x. This means that 2/3 * x equals x / 3. So x divided by 3 is 2.

Let's think about what happened next. Half of the french fries eaten by Dave were stolen by the seagull. That means the seagull ate seven french fries. Then three pigeons ate three french fries each. Each pigeon ate three french fries, so the three pigeons together ate nine french fries. Finally, a raccoon took two thirds of the remaining french fries, leaving one third of the remaining french fries. One third of the remaining french fries means 1/3 of the french fries that Dave ate. Since we know that Dave ate 14 french fries, 1/3 of the french fries that Dave ate is 14 / 3. And if the raccoon took two thirds of the remaining french fries, that means 14 / 3 minus 2/3. Two thirds of something is the same as multiplying by 2/3. So, 14 / 3 minus (14 / 3) * (2/3). Multiplying those fractions out, we get 14 / 3 - (14 * 2) / (3 * 3), which is 14 - 28 / 9. Dividing fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal. We can write this as 14 / 1 - 28 / 9, which is 14 - 28 / 9 - 1. So, there were originally 14 french fries.
