Julia bought a package of spoons, which had x number of spoons. Her husband bought another package, which had 5 spoons. Then Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So she ended up having 12 spoons in total. Let's write an equation to represent this situation. We know that 12 is equal to the amount of spoons in the package that Julia bought plus the 5 spoons from her husband's package. That means we can write the following equation: `12 = (x) + 5`. Solving for `x`, we get `x = 12 - 5 = 7`.
