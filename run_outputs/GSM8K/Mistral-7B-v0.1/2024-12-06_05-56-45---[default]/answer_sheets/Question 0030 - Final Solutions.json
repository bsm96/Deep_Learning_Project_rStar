Let's say Allen is 11 years old, so we need to find out how old Darrell is. 11 x 7 = 77. 11 + 77 = 88. So that makes Darrell 88 years old.

A + 10/B + 10 = 7:11 + 10 or (A+10)/(B+10) = 7/11 + 10/11. We can rewrite the equation like this: (A+10)(11)/(B+10)(11) = 7*11 + 10*11 = 88 + 110 = 198. We can divide both sides by 11 to get (A+10)/(B+10) = 198/11. We need to solve the equation for A. We first multiply both sides by B+10 to get A+10 = (198/11)*(B+10).
