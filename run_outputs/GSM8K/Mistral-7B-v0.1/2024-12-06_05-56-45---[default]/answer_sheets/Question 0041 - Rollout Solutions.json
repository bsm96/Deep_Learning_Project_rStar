We need this information for later.", "2": "Read the second condition about Polly who can throw the gold javelin that can slay dragons, but only up to 400 feet. This tells us that if she wants to hit the dragon with the javelin, she cannot get too close or else she would be hit by the dragon's flames."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Perg, the great dragon who lives on Mt. Farbo, can breathe fire up to 1000 feet away. Polly can throw the gold javelin which can slay dragons, up to 400 feet, but within the reach of the dragon's flames. When she holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw it three times as far without the gemstone. The question asks how far past the dragon's flames can Polly safely stand while still hitting the dragon with the gold javelin.\n\nThis problem can be solved by analyzing the given conditions. Let's start by determining how close Polly can get to Perg before she is hit by the dragon's flames. According to the first condition, Perg can breathe fire up to 1000 feet away. If Polly stands closer than this, she will be burned by the flames.\n\nNext, let's look at the second condition. It states that Polly can throw the gold javelin, which can slay dragons, up to 400 feet. But since she is standing closer than the distance Perg can breathe fire (1000 feet), she will be hit by the flames. Therefore, Polly cannot stand closer than 400 feet away from Perg.\n\nNow, we know that Polly can stand no closer than 400 feet away from Perg, because otherwise she would be burned by the flames. However, according to the third condition, when Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin three times further without the gemstone. That means if she throws the javelin from 1200 feet away instead of just 400 feet, she will be safe from the flames.\n\nTherefore, with the sapphire gemstone, Polly can stand 1200 feet past the range of Perg's flames while still being able to hit him with the gold javelin.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "The great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 1000 feet.
