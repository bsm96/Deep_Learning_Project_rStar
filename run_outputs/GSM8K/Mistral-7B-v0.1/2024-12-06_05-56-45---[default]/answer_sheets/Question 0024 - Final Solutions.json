Kyle paid $19.50 for the book with 25% discount. To calculate the original price, we can use the formula. We want to find what value we need to put into the equation so that the result is $19.50. The equation is Original Price x (Discount Percentage / 100) = 19.50. Let's rearrange it to solve for the original price: Original Price = 19.50 / (Discount Percentage / 100). Since the discount percentage is 25%, we can plug that value into the equation and get: Original Price = 19.50 / (25 / 100) = 19.50 / 0.25 = 19.50 * 4 = 78.
