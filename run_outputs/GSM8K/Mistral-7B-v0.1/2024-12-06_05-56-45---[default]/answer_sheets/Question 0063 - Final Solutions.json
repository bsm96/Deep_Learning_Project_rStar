The problem states Aleena pays $140 per month for a streaming service.", "2": "Multiply the initial cost per month by the number of months she is billed for in the first half of the year. This is the full initial amount for the first half of the year."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. Aleena pays 140 dollars per month for a streaming service. The full initial amount for the first half of the year is 140 dollars multiplied by the number of months in the first half. If Aleena is billed the full initial amount for the first half of the year, then that means 140 dollars multiplied by 6 months. 140 dollars times 6 months is 840. In addition, Aleena is then charged 10 percent less per month for the remainder of the year. To find out what that would mean, we need to know the number of months in the second half. Since there are 12 months in a year, there must be 6 months in the first half and 6 months in the second half. If Aleena is charged 10 percent less per month for the remainder of the year, we can figure out how much she pays for the remaining 6 months. If she paid 140 dollars per month for the first 6 months, then she is going to pay 10 percent less per month for the remaining 6 months. That means 10 percent less than 140 dollars per month for the remaining 6 months. So instead of paying 140 dollars per month for those 6 months, she is going to pay 140 dollars per month minus 10 percent. 10 percent of 140 dollars is 14 dollars. So instead of paying 140 dollars, she is going to pay 140 dollars minus 14 dollars. 140 dollars minus 14 dollars is 126 dollars. 126 dollars multiplied by 6 months is 756. Add 756 to 840, and that equals 1596. Aleena is going to pay a total of 1596 dollars for the entire year of this service.

In the first half of the year, Aleena paid 6 months worth of $140, which is 6 x 140 = 840 dollars. Then for the second half of the year, she would pay 10% less than she would originally.
