We know that 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photo of ducks is the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold. That is equivalent to 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photo being the same as the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold. So we know that 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photo is equal to the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Let's call the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold Y. So, 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photo is equal to Y.\n\nNow, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Let's call the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold Z. We know that Z is 6 times Y. Since we also know that 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photo is equal to Y, we can rewrite this statement as 6 times 50 times the number of birds in Jamal's photo is equal to Z. We can simplify this by removing all the multiplication signs and parenthesis. This leaves us with 300 times the number of birds in Jamal's photo being equal to Z.\n\nNow, we know that Z is equal to 1800. By substituting this into our equation, we get 300 times the number of birds in Jamal's photo is equal to 1800. Dividing both sides of the equation by 300, we get that the number of birds in Jamal's photo is equal to 6.
