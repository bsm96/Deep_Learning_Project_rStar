They each have a different number of crabs. Let's assign them labels to keep track of their numbers of crabs. We can say Bo has B crabs, Monic has M crabs, and Rani has R crabs. Let's think about what we know about these crab numbers. First, we know Bo has 40 crabs because it was mentioned in the problem. Second, we know Monic has fewer crabs than Bo because it was said she has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. So, let's write down our first equation: M < B. Third, we know Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic because it was mentioned in the problem. So, let's write down another equation: R > M. Now we need to solve for B, M, and R. To solve for M, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the first equation: M < B - 4. We know that R is greater than M, so we can substitute M < B - 4 into the second equation: R > M < B - 4. Next, we can add 4 to both sides of this equation: R > B - 4. Now we know that R is greater than B - 4. We also know that B is equal to 40, since we know that Bo has 40 crabs. Therefore, we can substitute 40 for B in the inequality: R > 40 - 4. This simplifies to R > 36. Finally, we can solve for R by adding 4 to both sides of this inequality: R > 36 + 4. This simplifies to R > 40. So, we know that R is greater than 40, but we don't know exactly how much greater. To find out exactly how much greater R is than 40, we can plug 40 back into the first equation: M < B - 4. Since we know that R is greater than B - 4 and we know that B is equal to 40, we can conclude that M < 40 - 4 = 36. So, Monic has 36 crabs. Now we can use this information to figure out exactly how many crabs each person has. Bo has 40 crabs, Monic has 36 crabs, and Rani has R crabs. Since we know that R is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 36 + 10 = 46, we can conclude that R is equal to 46 crabs.
