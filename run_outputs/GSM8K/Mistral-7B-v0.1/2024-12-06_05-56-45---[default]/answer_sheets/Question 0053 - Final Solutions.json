The answer is 520.", "value": 0.3}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. The mechanic charged $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire. On Thursday, they fixed 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. So that makes 6 * 60 + 4 * 40 = $360 for truck tires and $160 for car tires, which adds up to $520. On Friday, they fixed 12 car tires but no truck tires. Each car tire costs $40. That is 40 * 12 = $480. So that means they made $480 - $520 = -$40 on Friday. Therefore the difference between those two days is 520 - (480 - 520) = 40. The answer is: 40.", "value": 0.53125}}}, "rollout_id": 0}]
