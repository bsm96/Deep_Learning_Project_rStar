If Tommy charges $3 per slice for a brownie and $4 per slice for a cheesecake, then we can solve this problem with algebra. Let us denote x as the cost per slice of the brownie and y as the cost per slice of the cheesecake. We know that x + y = 7 (since 3 + 4 = 7) and x = 3 (since x is the cost per slice of the brownie). We want to find y. We can substitute our known information into our equation: 3 + y = 7. We can now solve this simple linear equation for y: 3 + y = 7, so y = 4.
