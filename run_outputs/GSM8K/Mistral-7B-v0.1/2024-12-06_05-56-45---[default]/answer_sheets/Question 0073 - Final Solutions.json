If she borrows money and pays monthly for three months, we can break it down into three separate steps:\n(1) 1st month (2) 2nd month (3) 3rd month\n\nFirst, we need to figure out what 2% of 750 is. That is (750 / 100) * 2 = 15. So 750 dollars plus 15 dollars is 765 dollars. So she will pay 765 dollars in the first month.\n\nSecond, we need to figure out what 2% of 765 is. That is (765 / 100) * 2 = 15.3. So 765 dollars plus 15.3 dollars is 780.3. So she will pay 780.3 dollars in the second month.\n\nThird, we need to figure out what 2% of 780.3 is. That is (780.3 / 100) * 2 = 15.606. So 780.3 dollars plus 15.606 dollars is 795.906. So she will pay 795.906 dollars in the third month.\n\nSo she will pay 765 dollars in the first month, 780.3 dollars in the second month, and 795.906 dollars in the third month.
