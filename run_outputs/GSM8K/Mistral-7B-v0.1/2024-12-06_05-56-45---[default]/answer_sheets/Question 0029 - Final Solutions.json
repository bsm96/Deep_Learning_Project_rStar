Gloria wants to spend as little as possible without going over the cost of the boots. The two pairs of high heels together will cost less than the price of the boots, so 5 dollars less. Let's see what the price of the boots is, and then we will subtract five to get the price of the two pairs of high heels. The price of the boots is the amount we need to spend in order not to go over the shoe budget. Let's call this X. We have X dollars, which is enough to buy the boots, but not the high heels. When we add the price of the boots to the price of the high heels, it equals the shoe budget. Thus, (X) + (cost of high heels) = shoe budget. (X) + (cost of high heels) = 123. Solving for cost of high heels, we find that cost of high heels = 123 - X. We want this to be 5 dollars less than the boots, thus cost of high heels = (boots) - 5. Substituting into our previous equation for cost of high heels, we find that (boots) - 5 = 123 - X. This simplifies to (boots) = 128 - X. Substituting this back into our previous equation for cost of high heels, we find that (cost of high heels) = (128 - X) - 5 = 123 - X, or (cost of high heels) = X.
