An adult will eat 10 lbs of potato salad. A child will eat half as much as an adult. So it is equivalent to eating 5 lbs of potato salad. If there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, we know the number of people. For example, if 100% is all of them, 20 adults are 20 / 100 * 100% = 20%. And 5 children are 5 / 100 * 100% = 5%. So if 100% is the number of people, the percent of adults is 20%, and the percent of children is 5%. Let's rewrite this into numbers. If there are 100 people, there would be 20% * 100 = 20 adults, and 5% * 100 = 5 children. We can use this formula to find out how many people are at the picnic.\n\n20% * (number of people) = 20 adults\n5%   * (number of people) = 5 children\n\nWe can solve these equations by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of each fraction. To find the reciprocal of a fraction, flip the fraction upside down by switching its numerator and denominator.\n\n(number of people) = 20 * 1/20\n(number of people) = 5 * 1/5\n\nNow let's combine the above formulas together, and we get:\n\n(number of people) = 20 * 1/20 + 5 * 1/5\n= 100/100\n= 100\n\nSo there are 100 people at the picnic.\n\nIn order to figure out how much potato salad Ted needs to bring, let's first calculate how much potato salad an adult eats. An adult eats 10 lbs. Because there are 20 adults, 20 adults together will eat 20 * 10 = 200 lbs. Let's add the amount that children eat too. Each child eats 5 lbs, and there are 5 children. That means children will eat 5 * 5 = 25 lbs. So the total amount of potato salad that everyone will eat is 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs.
