That means there were 30 bees in the hive in the third round. But none of these bees had already flown back in, so we can add them all to get a count of the bees that left the hive in the first three rounds. These three rounds included 30 + 30 = 60 bees flying away. However, the third round included a group of 30 bees that had already returned. To get rid of double-counting, you need to subtract the 15 bees that flew in during the second round. You would get 60 - 15 = 45 bees.
