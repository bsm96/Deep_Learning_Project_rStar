We know that it takes an hour to walk the first four miles. Since the second part of the hike is also two miles, we can assume that it takes another hour to finish that portion as well. This means the total time for hiking will be four hours. Next, we need to calculate the distance covered during each part of the hike. For the first four miles, we already know that it takes one hour. For the second two miles, it takes another hour. Therefore, the first four miles take up half of the total time, or two hours. Multiplying this by the average speed of four miles per hour yields a distance of eight miles. Similarly, the last two miles take up half of the total time, or two hours. Multiplying this by the average speed of four miles per hour again gives us a distance of eight miles. Finally, the required speed for the final part of the hike can be calculated using the formula for average speed: speed = distance / time. Since we want the overall average speed to match the desired value of four miles per hour, we can use this same formula for the final part of the hike. The desired distance for the final part of the hike is therefore 8. The required time for the final part of the hike is thus also 8 / 4 = 2 hours. To calculate the required speed, we divide the distance by the time: speed = 8 / 2 = 4 miles per hour.
