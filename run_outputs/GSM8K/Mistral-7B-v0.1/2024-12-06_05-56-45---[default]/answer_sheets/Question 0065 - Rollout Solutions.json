According to condition 1, Jim spends 2 hours watching TV before going to sleep. Afterwards, Jim reads for half as long. Half of 2 is 1 hour. Therefore, in total he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours. According to condition 2, this happens three times per week. Since it lasts 4 weeks, it means that 3 times per week for 4 weeks equals 12 times. We need to multiply 3 x 4.
