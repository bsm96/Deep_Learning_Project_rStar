Ten of them cost her $10 each, so she paid 10 * 10 = $100 for these ten boards. Five of them cost her $16 each, so she paid 16 * 5 = $80 for these five boards. To calculate the selling price, we need to multiply with the current price. Since the current price is 50% higher than what she paid for the boards, we can get the current price by increasing the selling price by 50%. In other words, we can get the current price by multiplying 1.50 times the original price. As such, we multiply 1.50 times the price she originally paid to get the selling price. We therefore get 1.50 * 100 = $150 for ten boards and 1.50 * 80 = $120 for five boards. Overall, she makes 150 + 120 = $270 from selling all fifteen pieces of lumber.
