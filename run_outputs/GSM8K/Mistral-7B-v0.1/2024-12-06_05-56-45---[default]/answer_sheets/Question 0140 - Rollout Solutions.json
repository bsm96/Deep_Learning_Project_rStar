The 20 available cars for rent can be divided into three categories. One is the automatic car category. It has 12 cars. Another one is the manual car category. It also has 4 cars. So there should be (20 - 12 - 4) = 4 cars in the last category, which are semi-automatic cars. We know there are 4 semi-automatic cars. The number of total cars is 20. Divide 4 by 20 to get the percentage of semi-automatic cars. 4 / 20 is 0.2. Multiply 0.2 by 100 to convert it to a percent. 0.2 x 100 is 20%. So 20% of the cars are semi-automatic.

Since there are 20 cars in total, and 12 are automatic and 4 are manual, 12 + 4 = 16 of the cars are not semi-automatic. That means 20 - 16 = 4 are semi-automatic. Next, we can find out what percentage that is. To find percentage, divide the amount by the whole. 4 / 20 = 0.2. Multiply by 100 to get percent. 0.2 x 100 = 20%.
