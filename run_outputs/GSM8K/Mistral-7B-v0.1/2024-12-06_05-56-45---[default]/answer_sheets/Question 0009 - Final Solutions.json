We are told that she worked for 45 hours. This means she worked 40 hours plus 5 hours of overtime. Let's calculate her regular earnings and her overtime earnings separately.\n\nHer regular earnings are calculated as follows:\nRate per hour = 10 dollars\nNumber of hours worked = 40 hours\nRegular earnings = Rate per hour x Number of hours worked\n= 10 dollars x 40 hours\n= 400 dollars\n\nHer overtime earnings are calculated as follows:\nOvertime rate per hour = 1.2 times her regular hourly rate\n= 1.2 x 10 dollars\n= 12 dollars\nNumber of hours worked overtime = 5 hours\nOvertime earnings = Overtime rate per hour x Number of hours worked overtime\n= 12 dollars x 5 hours\n= 60 dollars\n\nSo her total earnings this week are 400 dollars + 60 dollars = 460 dollars.

We are given that Eliza's regular hourly rate is 10 dollars per hour for the first 40 hours. Therefore, Eliza earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours.
