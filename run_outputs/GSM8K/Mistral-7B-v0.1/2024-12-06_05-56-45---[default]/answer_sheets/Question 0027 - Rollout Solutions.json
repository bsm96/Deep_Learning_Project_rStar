Cynthia starts off with a supply of ice cream of 15 servings. Every night, she uses up 1 serving, which means she eats 60 servings over 60 nights. So she used 60 servings of ice cream after 60 days. A carton has 15 servings of ice cream. So we need to divide 60 servings by 15 servings per carton. 60/15 = 4 cartons of ice cream. We know that one carton costs $4.00.
