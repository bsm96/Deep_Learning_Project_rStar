To begin with, one glass is $5, but the rest of the glasses are only 60% of that. Let's call this amount x. That means we have x + 5 as the cost for all 16 glasses. To determine what x is, let's write out each glass. We have x, x/2, x/4, x/8, ..., x/32. Each glass except for the first costs less than the previous one. If you add up all these amounts, you get 15x/15. So we have 15x/15 + 5, or (15 + 1)/15 x. But since x is the last glass, it costs the same as a regular glass. This means that x is $5.

There are 16 glasses in total. The first one costs 5 dollars, so we know it is 5 dollars. We can add up all prices like this: (1 x 5) + (1 x 60% x 5) + ... + (1 x 60%^15 x 5). So the final amount will be (1 x 5) + (1 x (60% x 5)) + (1 x (60%^2 x 5)) + ... + (1 x (60%^15 x 5)). Since 60% = 0.6, 60%^2 = 0.6 x 0.6 = 0.36, and so on. So our expression becomes 5 + 5*0.6 + 5*0.36 + ... + 5*0.6^15. This simplifies to 5*(1 + 0.6 + 0.36 + ... + 0.6^15). We can use geometric sum formula to expand this: 5*(1 + 0.6 + 0.36 + ... + 0.6^15)= 5*(-1/1.6 - (-1.6)/(1.6)^2 - ... + 1/(1.6)^16). Since 1/1.6 + (-1.6)/(1.6)^2 + ... + 1/(1.6)^16 = 1 + (-1/1.6) + (-1/1.6)^2 + ... + (-1/1.6)^15 = 1 / (1-(-1/1.6)), we get 5*(-1/1.6 - (-1.6)/(1.6)^2 - ... + 1/(1.6)^16)= 5*(-1/1.6 - (-1.6)/(1.6)^2 - ... + 1/(1.6)^16)*(1+1.6)+5=-10/1.6+5*5=5/3.
