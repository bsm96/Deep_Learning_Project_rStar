Dana can run 4 times faster than she can walk. Skip is half as fast as running. Let's say running speed is R, walking speed is W, and skipping speed is S.

W = 3 / 2 miles per hour. One third of the time running means three times running time. Two thirds of the time walking means two times walking time.

We know that she skips for 1/3 of the time at 3 miles per hour (Condition 4). Therefore, the distance covered during this time is 1/3 * 6 = 2 hours at 3 miles per hour. This equals 2 * 3 miles or 6 miles. We can equate it to the earlier result for a system of equations: 2y + 8 = 6. Subtracting both sides from 2y results in 8 - 2y = -6, so we can substitute -6 for 2y to get 2y + 8 = -6 + 8 = 2, resulting in y = 1.

To figure out the answer, we need to apply all the rules that we know about running and skipping. Condition 1 says that 1 mile per hour takes 60 minutes.
