We are told that the price of a chicken meal is $12 and that a pack of milk costs $3. Also, the price of an apple is $1.50 and a pizza costs $8.50 per box.\n\nWe also know that Marie ordered a chicken meal, 5 packs of milk, 4 apples, and an unknown amount of pizza. The total cost of her order is $50.\n\nNow let's think step by step about how to solve this problem. We can start by figuring out how much it would cost if Marie only ordered the chicken meal, the milk, and the apples. That would be $12 plus $15 plus $6, which equals $33.\n\nSince the total cost of the order was $50, we can subtract $33 from $50 to find out how much Marie paid for the pizza. This means that she paid $50 - $33 = $17 for the pizza.\n\nTo find out how many pizza boxes Marie ordered, we need to divide $17 by $8.50. This means that Marie ordered $17 / $8.50 = 2 pizza boxes.\n\nSo, in summary, the answer to the question is that Marie ordered 2 pizza boxes.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza.
