Let's call the average time spent per person T, and the average cost paid by patients C, and the average charge to hospital D. So we can say that each visit takes about T/2 hours, since each patient spends 24 minutes with the doctor. We also know that revenue R = C*500, because 500 people were seen each day, and each pays 200 dollars. Expense E = D*200, because 200 patients were seen for every hour that doctors worked, and doctors earn 150 dollars an hour. Since the hospital wants to know how much money it makes overall, this means that profit P = R-E. Since we know all of those values, plugging them into our formula gives us P=200*500-150*200=50,000-30,000=$20,000.
