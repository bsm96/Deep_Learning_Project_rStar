According to condition 2, the probability of getting a result greater than 3 is ______ percent more likely than getting two consecutive even numbers. To calculate the difference in likelihood between these two events, we can use the following formula: probability(event1) - probability(event2). event1 is the event of getting a result greater than 3, and event2 is the event of getting two consecutive even numbers. Let's start with calculating the probabilities for each event. To get a result greater than 3, there are only 3 possible outcomes out of 6: 4, 5, and 6. So the probability of getting a result greater than 3 is (3/6), or 50%. To get two consecutive even numbers, there are only two possible outcomes out of 6: 2 and 4. So the probability of getting two consecutive even numbers is (2/6), or 33.33%. Therefore, the difference in likelihood between these two events is (50% - 33.33%) = 16.67%, which means that it is 16.67% more likely to get a result greater than 3 than to get two consecutive even numbers.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 3}]
