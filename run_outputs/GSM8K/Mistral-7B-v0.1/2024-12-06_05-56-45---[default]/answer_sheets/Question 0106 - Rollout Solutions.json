Each box has width and height of 5 inches and depth of 4 inches. 1 inch is taken off each dimension for the walls. So the inner dimensions are 5 - 1 = 4 by 6 - 1 = 5 by 4 - 1 = 3. The volumes of three boxes can be computed as 4 * 5 * 3 = 60 cubic inches. So the total volume of 3 boxes is 60.

The formula for calculating the volume of a rectangular prism is length x width x height. For Box 1, we have 5 inches length, 6 inches width, and 4 inches height, so its volume is 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 cubic inches. For Box 2, we have the same dimensions but we need to subtract the thickness of the wall from the length, width, and height, so it is (5 - 1) x (6 - 1) x (4 - 1) = 9 x 5 x 3 = 135 cubic inches. And for Box 3, we have the same formula as for Box 2, but using the remaining dimensions, so it is (5 - 1) x (6 - 1) x (4 - 1) = 4 x 5 x 3 = 60 cubic inches.
