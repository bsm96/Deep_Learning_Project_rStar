Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour.  He is sailing from 1 to 4 PM.  He then travels back at a rate of 6 mph. So let's calculate how far he traveled.  His speed is 10 miles per hour.  3 hours is 3 times.  He went 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.  That means he traveled 3 * 10 = 30 miles.  After he returned, he traveled 6 miles per hour for an unknown amount of time. Let's figure out how long he was gone for. The distance he traveled is 10 times the amount of time he was gone.
