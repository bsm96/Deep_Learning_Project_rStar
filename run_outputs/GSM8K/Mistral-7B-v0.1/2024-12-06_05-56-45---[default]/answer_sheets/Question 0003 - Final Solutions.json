Let's solve this problem step by step. First, we need to calculate how many meters James runs per week. Since he trains three times a week and each training session consists of three sprints, we can multiply 3 (the number of times he trains) by 3 (the number of sprints in a single training session). This gives us a total of 9 meters per week. Next, we need to multiply 9 (the total meters per week) by 60 (the number of meters each sprint is completed), which results in 540 meters per week.
