Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. One pair of shorts costs $16.50, one pair of pants costs $22.50, and one pair of shoes costs $42. First let's calculate how much we spent on shorts and pants. $16.50 * 3 = $49.50. $22.50 * 3 = $67.50. So $49.50 + $67.50 is 117. We spent $117 on those two items. We also spent $126 on shoes.
