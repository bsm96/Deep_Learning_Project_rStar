After distributing straw pieces, 20 straw pieces are distributed among the rabbit group. We know that each rabbit gets 5 straw pieces, so we can calculate the number of rabbits in the group as 20 / 5 = 4. Therefore, the number of rats in each cage is 18 / 6 = 3.

Condition 1: 160 straw pieces are distributed across multiple rodent groups: rats in 3 cages, 10 cages of hamsters, and a group of rabbits. Condition 2: Each rat receives 6 straw pieces. Condition 3: Each hamster receives 5 straw pieces. Condition 4: A total of 20 straw pieces are distributed among the rabbit group.

We know that the total number of straws is 160, which is distributed across three kinds of animals: rats, hamsters, and rabbits. First we can figure out the number of straws for each kind of animal using Conditions 2-4: 3*6=18 for the rats; 10*5=50 for the hamsters; 20 for the rabbits. Then we can calculate how many rats are in each cage based on these numbers. We know that there are 6 rats per cage, so if there are only 18 straws for the rats, there must be 3 rats in each cage.
