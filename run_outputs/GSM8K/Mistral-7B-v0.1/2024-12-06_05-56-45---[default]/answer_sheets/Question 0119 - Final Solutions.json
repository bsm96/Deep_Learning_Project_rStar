We know the following: 1) Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, so Lylah's salary was 70% of Adrien's; 2) Four years later, his salary had increased by 40%, so Lylah's salary also had increased by 40%; 3) Adrien made $40000 four years ago. Let's try to solve this problem based on these facts.\n\nFirst, we can find out Lylah's salary four years ago. Since her salary is 70% of Adrien's, we can use the equation 0.7 * A = L, where A is Adrien's salary four years ago, and L is Lylah's. Solving for A, we get A = 0.7 * L. Substituting in our values for L, we get A = 0.7 * 40000 = 28000. This means that Lylah made $28000 four years ago.\n\nNext, we need to figure out Adrien's salary four years ago. We know that his salary increased by 40%. Let's call this increase X. Then the equation would be (A+X) * 1.4 = B, where A is Adrien's salary four years ago, B is his salary now, and 1.4 is the multiplier for the increase. Solve for A, and you get A = (B/1.4) - X. Plugging in values for B and X, we get A = (40000 / 1.4) - 16000 = 22000. This means that Adrien made $22000 four years ago.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate their total salary four years later. The sum of Adrien's and Lylah's salaries is B + L. Using our values, we have B = 40000, and L = 28000. So the total salary four years later is 40000 + 28000 = 68000.\n\nIn summary, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is 68000.
