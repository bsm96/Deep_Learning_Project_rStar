This question can be hard to understand. Let's draw a picture. Here, Julia's boat goes from point A (starting location) to point B (shore). She goes one foot at a time and takes on two liters of water per ten feet. The question asks us how much water the boat takes on before reaching the shore. The boat takes on 2 liters of water every 10 feet. We know that it takes 16 seconds for the boat to row 20 feet, or 2 seconds for 10 feet. 16 / 2 = 8. Then, 8 * 10 feet = 80 feet. When she reaches the shore at point B, this means that the boat has traveled 80 feet. Then the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it goes. 80 / 10 = 8. So the boat takes on 2 liters for every 10 feet for 8 times, which is 2*8 = 16 liters of water. We want to find out how much water the boat takes on before it gets to point B. Since the boat starts at point A, the boat takes on 16 liters of water before reaching point B.

If it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, then 16 seconds for 10 feet would be 10 / 20 = 1/2 of 16. That is 8 seconds. This is the time spent traveling 10 feet.

First, we need to calculate how many liters she takes on per second. That will be (2/10) / 16. Or, since the fraction is a division problem, we could just divide the numerator and denominator by 10, resulting in (2/10)/(10/16). This is equal to 2/10 * 10/16. By multiplying across, this is equal to 20/160. Multiply 20/160 by 64 to get (20/160) * 64. That is 20/2.5. 20 divided by 2.5 is 8. Therefore, the boat took on 8 liters of water.
