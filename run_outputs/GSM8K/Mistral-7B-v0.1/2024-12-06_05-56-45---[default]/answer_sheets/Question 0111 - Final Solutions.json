This question can be hard to understand. Let's draw a picture. Here, Julia's boat goes from point A (starting location) to point B (shore).

The boat takes on 2 liters of water every 10 feet. We know that it takes 16 seconds for the boat to row 20 feet, or 2 seconds for 10 feet. 16 / 2 = 8. Then, 8 * 10 feet = 80 feet.
