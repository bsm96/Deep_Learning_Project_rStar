From the oceanfront to the other edge is 42 miles. Every three miles it covers in 10 minutes. So in order to cover the entire length, it must take 42 / 3 = 14 times ten minutes. Ten minutes is one sixth of an hour, so one ten minute interval would be one sixth of an hour or 1/6 hours. To convert this to a fraction of an hour, multiply by 60. This means that 1/6 hours becomes 60/6 which is 10 minutes. Since we already converted, we can just multiply 10 minutes by 14. That is 10 * 14 = 140 minutes.
