To make a total profit of 400, he needed to sell 400 / 10 = 40 bags. If the cost of each bag was $20, he needed to spend $20 x 40 = 800 to buy the bags. Since the cost of transporting each bag was $2, the total cost of transporting all 40 bags was 40 x 2 = 80. The amount left over for profit was 400 - (800 - 80) = 520. So the trader bought 40 bags for a total cost of $800 and sold them for $1200, making a profit of $520.
