John first drove 3 hours at 60 mph. This was 60 * 3 = 180 miles. Next, he spent 2 hours standing still and another half hour driving at 30 mph. That's 30 * .5 + 0 = 15 miles. Finally, he drove the rest of the 4 hours at 80 mph. That's 80 * 2 = 160 miles. 180 + 15 + 160 is 355 miles. The answer is: 355 miles.", "value": 0.0625}}}, "rollout_id": 2}]
