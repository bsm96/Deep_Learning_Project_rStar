Also, it is stated that an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. This means that each orange would cost 45 - 5 = 40$. Using this information, the total amount of money spent by Dillon can be calculated using these values. We need to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. The total price for 4 watermelons is 4*45 = 180$. The total price for 20 peppers is 20*15=300$. And finally, the total price for 10 oranges is 10*40 = 400$.
