That means that one third of all her vacuums went to the green house. Let's call the total number of vacuums she started with N. One third of N is equal to the number of vacuums that went to the green house. What we don't know yet is what happened to the rest. The next piece of information is that she sold 2 more to the red house. This means that she sold N/3 + 2. But not all of them went to the red house. She also sold half of the remaining vacuums. N/3 + 2 - (N/3) / 2 is N/3 + 1. This is because N/3 + 2 represents the number of vacuums she sold in total, which included the ones she sold at the red house. When we subtracted the part sold at the red house, we were left with N/3 + 2 - N/3, which can be simplified to just N/3 + 1. And finally, there are 5 left. Let's call this M. So if N is the total number of vacuums she started with, then M is the number of vacuums she still has left. M is equal to N/3 + 1 - 5. We can simplify this to N/3 + 1 - 5/1. So N/3 + 1 - 5/1 becomes M. Multiply both sides by 1/3: 1/3 * N/3 + 1 - 5/1 * 1/3. Distributing, this becomes 1/3 * N/3 + 1 - 5/3. Simplifying gives us M = N/3 + 5/3. Subtracting 1/3 from both sides results in M - 1/3 = N/3 + 5/3 - 1/3, or M - 1/3 = N/3 + 2/3. So M - 1/3 is equal to N/3 + 2/3. Solving for M gives us M - 1/3 - N/3 = 2/3. Adding 1/3 to both sides gives us M - 1/3 + 1/3 - N/3 = 2/3 + 1/3, or M - 1/3 = N/3 + 2/3. Subtracting 1/3 again gives us M = N/3 + 2/3.

Suppose Melanie sells them all to the three houses. First, she will sell 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners to the green house. That means she will sell x / 3 vacuum cleaners. Second, she will sell 2 more to the red house. Third, she will sell half of what is left. So we will sell (x / 3) + 2 + (x / 2). This makes sense because all she needs to do is calculate x / 3 + 2 + x / 2 = 2x / 3 + 2. So Melanie will be left with (x - (2x / 3 - 2)) vacuum cleaners. Substitute for x in the formula to get (x - (2x / 3 - 2)). Rearrange to solve for x to get x = 15. Therefore, the original number of vacuum cleaners was 15.
