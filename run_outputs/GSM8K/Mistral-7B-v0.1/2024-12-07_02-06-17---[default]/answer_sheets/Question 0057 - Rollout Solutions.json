One box weighs 15 pounds, so 15 x ? = total weight of all the boxes.", "3": "We need to know how many boxes we can fit on the truck.

Let's call the total weight of all the boxes W. To figure out W, we multiply 15 by the number of boxes. This is 15 * N (where N is the number of boxes). If we divide both sides of the equation by 15, we get 15/15 * N = W/15. This simplifies to N = W/15. According to condition 2, the total weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. So according to condition 3, the maximum number of boxes that can fit on the truck without exceeding the weight limit is W/15 where W = 3755. To figure out what this is, we plug in 3755 into W, so W = 3755, and we solve for W/15. 3755/15 = 250.
