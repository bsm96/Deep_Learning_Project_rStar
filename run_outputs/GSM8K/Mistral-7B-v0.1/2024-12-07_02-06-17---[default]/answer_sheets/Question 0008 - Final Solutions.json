John started at 60mph and drove for 3 hours. So he covered 60 x 3 miles. Then he turned around and went back home, but was stuck in traffic for 2 hours. That means he drove at 0mph for 2 hours. Then he drove at 30mph for 30 minutes. After that he drove at 80mph for 4 hours. Firstly, I want to check if these speeds allow John to cover the original 60miles plus the return trip. 60mph for 3hours = 60*3 = 180 miles. Adding that to 30mph for 30minutes = 30*0.5 = 15 miles, and 80mph for 4hours = 80*4 = 320 miles, we get 180+15+320 = 425 miles. This is greater than 60miles, so the plan works. Secondly, I am going to figure out how long it would take John to complete the full trip at a speed of 60mph, using the formula s=ut+1/2at^2, where t is time (in hours) and s is the distance (in miles). So we plug in: s=60t+1/2(0)(t^2)=60t. We can simplify this to 60t=x, which means t=x/60. Plugging x=425 into this equation, we get t=425/60=7.083333333333333 hours. So John will complete the full trip in 7.083333333333333 hours. Since it took him 4 hours, we can say that he arrived home after 4 hours.
