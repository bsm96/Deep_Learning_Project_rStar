A watermelon costs 3 times as much as a pepper. An orange costs 5 less than a watermelon. If you look at this way, you can see that an orange costs 20 dollars less than 3 times a pepper. So if it takes 3 peppers to get one watermelon, then one watermelon costs 15 (3 x 5) dollars, so the pepper also costs 5 dollars, since they cost 3 times each other.

The question says that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. This means that each watermelon would cost 3 x 15 = 45$. Also, it is stated that an orange costs 5 less than what a watermelon cost. This means that each orange would cost 45 - 5 = 40$. Using this information, the total amount of money spent by Dillon can be calculated using these values. We need to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. The total price for 4 watermelons is 4*45 = 180$. The total price for 20 peppers is 20*15=300$. And finally, the total price for 10 oranges is 10*40 = 400$.
