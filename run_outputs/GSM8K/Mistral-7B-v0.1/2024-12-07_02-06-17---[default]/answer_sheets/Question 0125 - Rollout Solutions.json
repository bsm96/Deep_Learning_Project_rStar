[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Julia was preparing for a dinner party at her house, where she intended to serve stew.

With her own use of 3 spoons, she had x + 5 - 3. Finally, after setting the table with 12 spoons, she had 12 - (x + 5 - 3) = 12 - x - 2 spoons. Because she started with x spoons and ended up with 12 - x - 2 spoons, we know that the difference between these two numbers is the number of spoons her husband brought. 12 - x - 2 - x = 10.
