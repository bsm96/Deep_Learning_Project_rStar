This means that when he finished baking, he had 52 cookies. Then he realized he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended to. So now he has a total of 52 + 15 = 67. Next, he dropped 5 cookies while putting them to cool. He ends up with 67 - 5 = 62. Finally, he says that he wanted to make twice as many as he did last year. This means he multiplied 52 by two to get his original goal. So twice as many is 2 * 52 = 104.
