That makes Mark one year younger than Jean.  Two years ago Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. We can write this as 5 > 1/2 * Jean's age. This means that Mark's age is 5 + (1/2 * Jean's age). Let's call Mark's age m. Then we get: m = 5 + (1/2 * Jean's age). Lastly, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark. We can write this as 2 + m = Jean's age. Putting these together, we get: 2 + m = 5 + (1/2 * m)  or, rearranging,  2 * m = 5 + (1/2 * m). Solving this equation, we get: m = 20. This means that Mark is 20 years old.

We know that when he was younger than him.   Mark is 5 years older than Jan who was half her age at the time.  That means that two years ago mark was 7 years older than Jan.
