This means 16 cans of tomatoes were needed to make this amount of sauce. To get the number of tomatoes, we need to multiply 3 by 16. This gives us 48 tomatoes. But as stated above, when cooking sauce, tomatoes lose half their volume. Half of 48 is 24. So she used 24 tomatoes to make that batch of sauce.
