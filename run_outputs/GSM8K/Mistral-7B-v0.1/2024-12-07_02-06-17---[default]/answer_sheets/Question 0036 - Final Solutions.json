Condition 1 says Terry eats two yogurts per day. Condition 2 says that the current promotion price for yogurt is four for $5.00. Condition 3 says that we want to know the total amount spent on yogurt over this period. We can calculate this because Condition 2 tells us that if you buy four for $5.00, the price is $5/4 = 1.25. This means we need to multiply the number of yogurts per day by the number of days and the price of one yogurt. We get 2 * 30 * 1.25 = 75. Thus the total amount spent is 75.
