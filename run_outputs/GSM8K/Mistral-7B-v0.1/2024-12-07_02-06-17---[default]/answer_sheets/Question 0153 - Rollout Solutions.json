If a raccoon stole two thirds, then two thirds must not be stolen. Two thirds of the remaining fries are 2/3 x (fries remaining - 9) = 2/3 x (fries remaining - 9). To solve this equation, we need to multiply both sides by 3/2. So, 2/3 x (fries remaining - 9) x 3/2 = (fries remaining - 9) x 3/2. This simplifies to fries remaining x 3/2 - 9 x 3/2 = (fries remaining - 9) x 3/2. We can subtract 9 x 3/2 from both sides to get (fries remaining - 9) x 3/2 - 9 x 3/2 = 0, which simplifies to fries remaining x 3/2 = 9 x 3/2. Finally, dividing both sides by 3/2 gives us fries remaining x 3/2 / 3/2 = 9 x 3/2 / 3", "3": "Ants carried off a final fry, leaving five behind.
