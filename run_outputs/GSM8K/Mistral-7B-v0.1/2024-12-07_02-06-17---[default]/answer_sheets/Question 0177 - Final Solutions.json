First let's take a look at the whole list of conditions. There are three conditions. 1) Zaid earns $6000 per month. 2) Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel, and donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. 3) Zaid gives his daughter $200 to spend on her weekly expenses, and $700 to his wife for groceries and other household goods. The question asks what Zaid has remaining after all the expenses and donations. Let's apply condition 2 first. That means 6000/4 = 1500 goes to rent. That leaves us with 6000 - 1500 = 4500. We can subtract 1/3 of that or 4500/3 = 1500. That leaves us with 4500 - 1500 = 3000. Now we apply condition 3. That means 3000 / 2 = 1500. That leaves us with 3000 - 1500 = 1500.
