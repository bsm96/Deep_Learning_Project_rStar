Since it takes them 24 minutes to see a patient, which is half an hour, it means that 24 / 60 = 0.4 hours per patient. 0.4 hours times $150 per hour equals $60 per patient. 500 times $60 per patient equals $30000 for the doctors. The hospital charges $200 an hour. Since it takes them 24 minutes to see a patient, which is half an hour, it means that 24 / 60 = 0.4 hours per patient. 0.4 hours times $200 per hour equals $80 per patient. 500 times $80 per patient equals $40000 for the hospital.

So 500 patients each spend 24 minutes, so that makes 500 * 24 = 12,000 minutes for the whole day. So doctors spent 12,000 / 60 = 200 hours at work, or 200 x $150 = $30,000.
