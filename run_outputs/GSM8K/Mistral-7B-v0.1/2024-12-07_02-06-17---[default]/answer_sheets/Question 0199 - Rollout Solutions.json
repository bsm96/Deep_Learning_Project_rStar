This will help us determine the amounts paid by the two publishers. According to the question, Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. Since the amount is evenly split between the two publishers, we know that Mark edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher. Next, let's identify the payment rates for each publisher. According to the question, Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. And since Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, we can deduce that Publisher B pays Mark 10 cents per sentence (twice as much as 5). With this information, we can calculate the amount paid by each publisher. For Publisher A, Mark is paid 5 cents x 500 sentences = $25. And for Publisher B, Mark is paid 10 cents x 500 sentences = $50. Combining these amounts, we get the total amount Mark makes in a week, which is $25 + $50 = $75.
