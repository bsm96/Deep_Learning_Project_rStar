Then, if Eliza worked for 45 hours, the additional 5 hours are considered overtime. Since overtime pay is 1.2 times the regular hourly rate, her additional 5 hours of pay will be $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour. Total payment for the 5 overtime hours is 5 * 12 = $60. Since 40 hours earn $400 (40 * 10), the weekly total would be $400 + 60 = $460.
