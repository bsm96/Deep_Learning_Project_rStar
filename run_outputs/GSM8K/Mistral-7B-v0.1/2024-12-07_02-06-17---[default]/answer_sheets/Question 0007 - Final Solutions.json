Carla's download speed is 2 GB per minute. If we divide 200 GB by 2 GB per minute, we get 100 GB / 2 GB. The answer is: 100 minutes.\n\nHint: The first step when solving this problem is to convert 200GB into bytes, since Carla's computer downloads files in terms of bytes. This can be done by converting 200 GB to megabytes or kilobytes. To convert from gigabyte to megabyte, we multiply by 1,000 (since 1 megabyte equals 1000 megabits). Therefore, 200 GB x 1000 = 200,000 MB. Similarly, to convert from megabyte to kilobyte, we multiply by 1024 (since 1 kilobyte equals 1024 bits). Therefore, 200,000 MB x 1024 = 204,800 kB. Finally, we can convert 204,800 kB to bytes by multiplying by 8. Therefore, 204,800 kB x 8 = 1,638,400 bytes. The next step is to calculate how long it would take Carla to download the entire 200 GB file using her regular download speed of 2 GB per minute. This can be done by dividing the total number of bytes (1,638,400) by Carla's download speed (2 GB per minute), which yields 819,200/2=409,600 seconds. Since one hour is equal to 3,600 seconds, we can divide 409,600 seconds by 3,600 to get the time it would take Carla to download the file using her normal download speed of 2 GB per minute, which is approximately 112 hours.", "value": 0.1875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Carla is downloading a 200 GB file.
