Since he spends 1/4 of his salary on rent and 1/3 on car fuel, this means he spends 1/4 * 6000 = 1500$ on rent and 1/3 * 6000 = 2000$ on car fuel.", "2": "Calculate how much Zaid can donate to his charity.

Condition 3: He gives his daughter 200$ to spend on her weekly expenses, and 700$ to his wife for groceries and other household goods. Question: How much money does he have remaining after all those expenses and donations?", "ost_step": {"1": "Identify the initial amount of money earned. The problem states Zaid earns 6000$ per month.", "2": "Apply condition 2 and divide the amount by 4, 3, and half."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step. First let's take a look at the whole list of conditions. There are three conditions. 1) Zaid earns $6000 per month. 2) Zaid spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, 1/3 on car fuel, and donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. 3) Zaid gives his daughter $200 to spend on her weekly expenses, and $700 to his wife for groceries and other household goods. The question asks what Zaid has remaining after all the expenses and donations. Let's apply condition 2 first. That means 6000/4 = 1500 goes to rent. That leaves us with 6000 - 1500 = 4500. We can subtract 1/3 of that or 4500/3 = 1500. That leaves us with 4500 - 1500 = 3000. Now we apply condition 3. That means 3000 / 2 = 1500. That leaves us with 3000 - 1500 = 1500. Finally, we are asked about Zaid's remaining after all the expenses and donations. This is just the leftover amount of 1500$. The answer is: 1500$.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
