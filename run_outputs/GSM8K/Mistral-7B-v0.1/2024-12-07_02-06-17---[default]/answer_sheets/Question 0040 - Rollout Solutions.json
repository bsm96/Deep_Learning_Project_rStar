Let's call Brandon's iPhone \"X\". First of all, Ben's iPhone is 1/4 of Brandon's iPhone. So X * 1/4 is Ben's iPhone. Next, Suzy's iPhone is 1/2 of Ben's iPhone. So X * 1/4 * 1/2 is Suzy's iPhone. Since we know that Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, X * (1/4) * (1/2) = 1, so X = 1 * 4 * 2 = 8. This tells us that Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old.
