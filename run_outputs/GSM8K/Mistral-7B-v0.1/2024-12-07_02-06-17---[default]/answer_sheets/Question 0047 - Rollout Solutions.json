So if he buys 1 blue tie, then he also buys 2 red ties. The blue ties cost $40 each, so the red ties would cost $40 x 1.5 = 60 dollars each.  So he spends (1 x 40) + (2 x 60) = 100 + 120 = 220.

John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So he also buys twice as much as $40 for red ties. Twice of 40 is 80, so he spends 80 dollars on red ties. Since it is 50% more, he pays 1.5x what he pays for blue ties, which is 1.5x$200=300. So he pays 300 for red ties. His total spending is $200+300=$500.
