We need to sum up what Artie made selling different types of flowers. First, let's round to the nearest dollar. Rounding 12 to the nearest dollar gives us 12. Next, we multiply 12 by 2.74 to get the price of 12 marigold pots. Let's call that P. We get P = 12 * 2.74 = 32.88. Similarly, we can calculate the price of 9 petunia pots as N = 9 * 1.87 = 16.83 and the price of 17 begonia pots as B = 17 * 2.12 = 35.56. So Artie made P + N + B = 32.88 + 16.83 + 35.56 = 85.27 dollars. The answer is: 85.27.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
