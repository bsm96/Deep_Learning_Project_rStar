We know the original price of the bag of marbles was 20 dollars. Let's call this P0. First, let's calculate the price after 2 months. It'll be P0 * (1 + (percent increase / 100)). The percentage increase is 20%. So the new price is P0 * (1 + (20 / 100)) or P0 * 1.2. Let's say the price after 2 months is P1. Next, we want to calculate the price after another 2 months. The price will be P1 * (1 + (percent increase / 100)). And the percent increase will remain 20%. So the new price is P1 * (1 + (20 / 100)). Call this P2. Repeat this for all time periods. At the end, we'll have the price after 36 months. P2 is the price after 2 months. P3 is the price after 4 months. And so on. P36 is the price after 36 months.

A bag of marbles costs $20. It goes up by 20% of the original price every two months. After three months (36/12 = 3), it would go up by 3 x 20% = 60%.
