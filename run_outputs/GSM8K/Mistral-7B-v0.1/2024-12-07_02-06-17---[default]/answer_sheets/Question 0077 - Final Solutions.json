According to the hint, we know that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Also, we know that David does 2 * his amount of laundry (hint). Therefore, Sarah does 4 * David's amount of laundry. So, we can write Sarah does 4 * David's amount of laundry = 400 pounds of laundry. Let's solve for David's amount of laundry by dividing both sides of the equation by 4. That gives us David's amount of laundry = 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry. Now, we need to figure out how much laundry David does. According to the hint, we know that David does 2 * his amount of laundry, or 2 * 100 = 200 pounds of laundry. Finally, according to the hint, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.

We are asked to calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. This can be solved in two parts. First, let us figure out what Sarah does. The problem says that Sarah does four times as much laundry as David, so if David does 1 unit of laundry, then Sarah does 4 units of laundry. The problem also says that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, so if Sarah does 4 units of laundry, then Raymond does 2 units of laundry. Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, that means she does 4 * 100 = 400 units of laundry. Since Raymond does 2 units of laundry for every one unit of laundry that Sarah does, this means that Raymond does 2 * 400 = 800 units of laundry. Since David does 1 unit of laundry for every 4 units of laundry that Sarah does, this means that David does 1 * 400 = 400 units of laundry.
