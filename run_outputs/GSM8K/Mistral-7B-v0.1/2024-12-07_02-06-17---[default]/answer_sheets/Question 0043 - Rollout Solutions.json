According to the nutritional information, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. There are 5 servings in this 300g bag. 250 x 5 = 1250 calories. 1250 calories is the total amount of calories. It is a little more than half our daily allowance of 2000 calories. To find out how much we could eat, subtract our current caloric intake from the rest of the daily allowance: 2000 - 1800 = 200.
