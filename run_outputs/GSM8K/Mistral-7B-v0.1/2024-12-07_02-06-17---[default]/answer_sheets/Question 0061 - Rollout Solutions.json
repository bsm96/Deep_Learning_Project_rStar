Janet first paid $500 for the material to make the brooch. Then she paid $800 for the jeweler to construct it. That makes 1,300 dollars. Finally, she paid 10% of 1,300 dollars, which is 130 dollars.

Janet paid 1300 dollars to have the brooch made. The next thing she needs to pay for is insurance. Let's say the insurance is 10%. So 10% of 1300 is 0.10 * 1300 = 130. So she will have to pay 130 dollars to get the brooch insured. All in all, she would have to pay 1300 + 130 = 1430 dollars to get everything made for her daughter's brooch.
