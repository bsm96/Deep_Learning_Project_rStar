Firstly, I need to identify the number of downloads in the first month. According to the problem statement, this number is 60 downloads. Next, I need to multiply the number of downloads in the first month by 3, as the number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. So, 60 x 3 = 180 downloads in the second month. However, I also need to decrease this number by 30%, as the number of downloads in the third month reduced by 30%. Thus, 180 (downloads in the second month) x 0.7 (percentage reduction) = 126 downloads in the second month. Finally, I add together all the downloads for each month. In the first month, there were 60 downloads; in the second month, there were 126 downloads; and in the third month, there were 60 downloads (the original number). So, the total number of downloads over the three months is 60 + 126 + 60 = 246 downloads.
