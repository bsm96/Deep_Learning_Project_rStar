Let's call the number of boys n. The number of girls would be half this amount, or n/2. We are told that there are twice as many boys as girls. This means n = 2 times n/2, or n = 2n/2.

This means that for every teacher, there are 2 students. We are also given that there are 60 girls and 5 students to every teacher. This tells us that there are 60 / 5 = 12 teachers at the school.
