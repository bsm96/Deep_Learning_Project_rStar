For example, if she spent $10 for one board, it would now cost $15. If she spent $16 for another board, it would now cost $24. So for every dollar she paid before, the price was multiplied by 1.5. She has ten $10 boards, so she has ten times 10 or 100 dollars. And she has five $16 boards, which she will have five times 16 or 80 dollars. This means she has 100 + 80 = 180 dollars. But the new prices are $15 x 10 = 150 and $24 x 5 = 120. So the new value is 150 + 120 = 270. 270 minus 180 is 90.
