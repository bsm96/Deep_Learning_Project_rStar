[{"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Meredith is a freelance blogger who writes about health topics and submits to clients each day as her permanent job. A blog article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write about. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and  2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles in the three days.", "ost_step": {"1": "Let's start with finding the amount of time Meredith spent writing articles on Monday. Since it took her 4 hours to write one article, let's multiply 4 hours by the number of articles she wrote on Monday. We know that she wrote 5 articles on Monday, so 5 x 4 = 20. This means she spent 20 hours writing articles on Monday.", "2": "Next, let's find the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. We know that on Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than she did on Monday. Let's call this number \"n\". Then, we can say n x 4 = 20, since n represents the number of articles she wrote, and 4 represents the number of hours per article. Dividing both sides by 4, we get n = 5. So she wrote 5 articles on Tuesday.", "3": "Finally, we need to calculate the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday. We know she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, n x 2 = 10. But we also know that n = 5, so we have 5 x 2 = 10. Therefore, she wrote 10 articles on Wednesday.", "4": "Now that we know the number of articles she wrote on each day, we can calculate the total number of hours she spent writing. Monday was 20 hours, Tuesday was 20 hours, and Wednesday was 40 hours. In total, she spent 80 hours writing articles.", "5": "The answer is 80 hours."}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Given a list of conditions, please answer the question.
