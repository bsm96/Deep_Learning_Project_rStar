He runs 3 times per week for 3 hours the first day and half as much the other 2 days he runs. 3 hours is half the time it takes him to run 60 miles. So, if we divide 60 miles into 3 hours, we get 20 miles per hour.

First identify the total distance John runs in a week. The problem states he runs 60 miles a week. So that is the total distance. Identify how many times John runs per week. The problem states he runs 3 days a week. Next divide the total distance by the number of times he runs to get his average distance per run. 60/3 = 20. So he runs 20 miles a day.
