We know she can run 4 times faster than walk. That means when she runs 4 miles, she walks 1 mile. Let's say she walks 1 mile per hour. Then we can calculate her running speed. When she runs 1 mile per hour she also covers 4 miles. So we have 1/4 mile per hour for running. We want her skipping speed too. She skips half as fast as she runs. So her skipping speed is 1/8 mile per hour. In six hours she spends one third time running and two thirds time walking. Let's see how far she goes while running. While running she will cover 1 mile every 1/4 hour. So while spending one third time running she will cover (1/3) / (1/4) = (1/3) * (4/1) = 4/3 miles. This leaves 2/3 of the time. During this 2/3 of the time she will cover 1 mile every hour. So she will cover (2/3) * 6 = 4 miles. Adding both together we get 4/3 + 4 = 16/3 miles covered in 6 hours.

Let's find out how many miles she travels in each case: If she runs all the way, she will travel 12 miles / 12 mph = 1 hr. If she walks all the way, she will travel 1 mile / 1 mph = 1 hr.

Dana can run at 4 times the speed that she can walk. So the speed that she can walk is 1/4 of the speed that she can run. Since she skips at 1/2 the speed that she runs, it is also 1/2 of 1/4. So her walking speed is (1/4) / 2, or 1/8th of the speed that she can run. So her walking speed is 1/8 * 4 miles per hour. 1/8 * 4 is 1/2 a mile per hour, which means 0.5 miles per hour.\n\nTo determine the speed that she walks at, we need to find out the time that she runs, and the time that she walks. We know that she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, so for every hour she walks, she runs for 1/3 hour. Since she can skip at 3 mph, it takes her 3/(3/4)=4/3 hour to skip 3 miles. In one hour, she can skip 4/3 * 3=8/3 miles. When she runs, her speed increases four times, so it will take her 1/4*4/3=1/3 hour to run 8/3 miles. So in one hour, she can run 3*(8/3)/(4/3)=9 miles. So she spends 9/8*1 hour to run, and 9/8*2/3 hour to walk. In 6 hours, she can walk 9/8 * 2/3 * 6 hours, or 9/4 * 6 hours, or 27/4 hours. And she can run 9/8 * 1 * 6 hours, or 9/4 * 6 hours, or 27/4 hours.
