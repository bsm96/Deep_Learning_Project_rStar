Next, we need to figure out the profits from selling lemons. We know that 7 lemons sell for 7 x $1.5 = $10.50. However, each year there is also a $3 maintenance cost. That makes a net profit of $10.50 - $3 = $7.50 per year. We want the cost to be less than or equal to zero (because that means we will begin making a profit). Since we already defined cost, we can just write \"cost <= 0\" to mean this condition is true. To solve the equation, we use the following steps: cost <= 0 -> cost >= 0 -> cost = 0 -> cost = 90 -> time = n -> cost = $90 / $7.50 -> time = n -> $90 / $7.50 = n -> n = 12.
