Condition 1:  Carlos plants a lemon tree that costs $90 to establish. Condition 2:  Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.5 each.

This is equal to the establishment cost ($90).", "2": "Define a variable \"profit\" as the amount of money Carlos makes from selling the lemons. This equals the number of lemons produced (7) times the price per lemon ($1.5).", "3": "Define a variable \"maintenance\" as the annual maintenance cost for the lemon tree. This is equal to the value defined in the condition ($3)."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.\n\nIn order to calculate how long it takes before Carlos starts making a profit from the lemon tree, we need to know three things:\n1. The cost of the lemon tree ($90).\n2. The profit Carlos makes from selling the lemons ($7 x $1.5).\n3. The annual maintenance cost for the lemon tree ($3).\n\nDefine variables to represent these values:\ncost = $90\nprofit = $7 x $1.5 = $10.5\nmaintenance = $3\n\nNow we can solve the problem:\nIt will take until the profits generated by the lemon tree cover its costs plus the maintenance costs. In other words, we want the sum of the profit and the maintenance cost to be greater than or equal to the cost of the tree.\n\nWe can write this as an equation:\nprofit + maintenance >= cost\n$10.5 + $3 >= $90\n$13.5 >= $90\n\nSince this inequality is true, we can conclude that Carlos will start making a profit from the lemon tree after only 1 year!\n\nThe answer is: 1 year.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
