When buying flowers in packages of three for $2.50, you spend $2.50 / package. Since the question mentions 18 flowers, you would spend 18 x $2.50 = 45 dollars. When buying flowers in packages of two for $1, you spend $1 / package. You would spend 18 x $1 = 18 dollars instead. That means Vincent saves $45 - $18 = $27.
