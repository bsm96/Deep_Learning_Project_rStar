A merchant buys jewellery for $5,000 and sells it at 2.5% above the original price. So if you buy a jewelry for $5,000, you can sell it back for 1 + 2.5% = 1.025 x $5,000 = $5125.

So if you buy electronics for $8,000, you can sell it back for 1 + 1.2% = 1.012 x $8,000 = $8160. That means you make a profit of $8160 - $8000 = $160.
