Let's find out how much John spent on blue ties. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so he bought 200 / 40 = 5. Next, we want to find out how much the red ties cost. Since the red ties cost 50% more than blue ties, if a blue tie cost $40, the red ties would cost $40 * 1.50 = $60 each. Lastly, we can calculate how much he spent on red ties by multiplying the number of red ties by their price. Since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, if he bought 5 blue ties, he bought 10 red ties. He spent $200 on blue ties, so he spent 10 x 60 = 600 on red ties. He spent 200 + 600 = 800 dollars in total. The answer is 800.", "value": 0.21875}}}, "rollout_id": 1}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
