Solving this equation for Brooke's age gives us Brooke's age = 28 \u2013 Seth's age. Plugging this back into the original equation yields: 28 \u2013 2 \u00d7 (28 \u2013 Seth's age) = Seth's age. Simplifying, we get 2 \u00d7 Seth's age + Seth's age = 28.

Let's call Brooke's age x. That makes Seth's age 2x. After 2 years, their combined age is still 28. So 2x + x = 28. 3x = 28. x is 9. So Brooke's age is 9. And Seth's age is 2x or 18.
