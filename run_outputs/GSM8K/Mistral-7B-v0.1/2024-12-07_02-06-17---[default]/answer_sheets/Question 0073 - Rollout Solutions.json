Let's figure out the monthly payment first. The cost of each unit is $150. This means the monthly payment is 150/3 = 50. Then we multiply by 1.02, which means we add a 2% interest per month. So the monthly payment becomes 50 * 1.02 = $51.

There are 5 cell phones, and each costs $150, so the total cost is 5 x $150 = $750.", "2": "Calculate the amount of interest.

Shiela bought 5 cell phones for $150 each. That would be 5 x $150 = $750. 2% of this cost would be $15. So the total cost would be $750 + $15 = $765.
