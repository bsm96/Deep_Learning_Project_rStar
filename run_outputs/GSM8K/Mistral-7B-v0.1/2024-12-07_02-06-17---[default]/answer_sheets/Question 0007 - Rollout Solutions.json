Carla was able to download 2 GB per minute before she restarted the computer. That means 200 / 2 = 100 minutes of normal download time.

Carla was downloading 2 GB per minute. But there was an interruption halfway through the download, due to windows update. That took 20 minutes. So for that 20 minutes, there was no downloading. So we need to subtract that from the total time it would take to download 200 GB if everything went smoothly. 200 GB / 2 GB per minute is 100 minutes. 100 minutes - 20 minutes = 80 minutes.
