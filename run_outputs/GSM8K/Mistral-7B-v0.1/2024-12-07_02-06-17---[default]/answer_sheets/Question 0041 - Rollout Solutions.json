The javelin can be thrown for 400 feet if not holding the gemstone. With the gemstone, it can be thrown thrice as far, or 1200 feet. The dragon breathes its flames up to 1000 feet. Therefore, standing 1200 feet away from the dragon while throwing the javelin with the gemstone would let the javelin land right outside the dragon's breathing range. The answer is: 1200 feet.", "value": 0.25}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "The great dragon, Perg, sat high atop mount Farbo, breathing fire upon anything within a distance of 1000 feet.
