So she makes 35 times 20 dollars (or 20 * 35) per week. 35 * 20 is 700.\n\nNext we need to compute the pay rate and the hours for being a cheerleader coach. Jill earns 30 dollars per hour to be a cheerleader coach. This means she earns 30 dollars every hour. As the problem says, Jill coaches 15 hours per week. Thus she earns 15 dollars per week, or 15 * 30 = 450 dollars.\n\nThen we add the earnings for the coaching job and the teaching job together. 450 plus 700 is 1150. The answer is: 1150.", "value": 0.34375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
