Poppy started with 1000 jigsaw pieces. She placed a quarter of the pieces first, which would be 250. Then her mom placed a third of the remaining pieces. We can calculate the number of pieces left using the following formula: Remaining_pieces = Original_pieces - Placed_pieces - (Other_person's_placed_pieces / Total_pieces_in_set). In this case, Original_pieces = 1000, Placed_pieces = 250, Other_person's_placed_pieces = 1/3 * (Remaining_pieces), and Total_pieces_in_set = 1000. Solving for Remaining_pieces, we get 250 = 1000 - Remaining_pieces - (1/3 * Remaining_pieces / 1000), or 1000 = 2 Remaining_pieces. Therefore, Remaining_pieces = 0. The answer is: 0.", "value": 0.34375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
