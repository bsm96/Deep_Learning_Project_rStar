We know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees and twice as many babies as queens. Let's call the number of worker bees W, the number of baby bees B, and the number of queens Q.\n\nWe also know that W is equal to twice B, or W = 2B. And we know that B is equal to twice Q, or B = 2Q.\n\nSubstituting B into the first equation, we get W = 2(2Q). Simplifying this, we get W = 4Q.\n\nSo the number of worker bees is four times the number of queens. Let's call the number of queens Q. So the number of worker bees is 4Q.\n\nNow let's plug 4Q back into the second equation, W = 2B. This gives us 2B = 4Q. Dividing both sides by 2, we get B = 2Q.\n\nSo the number of baby bees is twice the number of queens.\n\nCombining these equations together, we can see that the number of queens must be 350/4.\n\nThe answer is: 350 / 4.", "value": 0.59375}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "There are 700 bees in a hive.
