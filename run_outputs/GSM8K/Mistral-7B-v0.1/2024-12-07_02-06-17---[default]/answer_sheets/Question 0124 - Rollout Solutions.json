One third of them are now stamped (so one third of 60). This means 1/3 of 60 = 20 letters are now stamped. 30 is double 15, which is half 30. 30 is half 60. That means the other half, or 30 letters, are still not stamped. The answer is: 30.", "value": 0.21875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Jennie is helping at her mom's office.
