The problem states Richard lives in an apartment building with 15 floors."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Since there are 15 floors in the building, it means that there are 15*8=120 apartments in the building. It also says that 3/4 of the building is occupied. Since 3/4 = .75, this means that 75% of the 120 apartments are occupied. To calculate the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from 120. .75 of 120 = 90 occupied units. Therefore, there are 120 - 90 = 30 unoccupied units.", "value": 0.46875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Richard lives in an apartment building with 15 floors.
