There are twelve fewer rabbits than the combined number of dogs and cats. We can find out the total number of animals if we know how many cats there are. Let's call it c. It must satisfy this equation: (c + d) - 12 = 12 => c + d = 24. So the total number of animals is 24. Since there are 12 fewer rabbits, then we need to subtract 12 from 24 to get the number of rabbit pets. 24 - 12 = 12.
