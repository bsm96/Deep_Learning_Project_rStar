The problem tells us he played for 40 minutes. Next, let's look at how many points he scored in the first 20 minutes. We know he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes. Since he scored 4 points in the first 20 minutes, we can assume he also scored 4 points in the second 20 minutes. However, the problem says he scored 25% more points in the second 20 minutes. That would mean he scored 4+0.25*4=5 points in the second 20 minutes. Finally, we add these together to get 4+5=9 points.
