Therefore the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas for the next span of 2 months considering the consumption rate remained constant throughout those years without any surplus/deficit situations happening. To summarize, ((total requirement per month)*(number_of_months)) equates to our overall goal; herein putting into application the basic algebraic concept representing linearity i.e., y=mx+c ,where 'm'( slope ) could represent consumption patterns as seen above being uniform across different scenarios or timeframes .
