        " (total) - 8417 (men) - 9092 (women), which equals 6277 people who aren't adult males or females; therefore those would logically be assumed as kids since no other demographics/age groups seem present. ",
        " (men) leaves us with 15369 people who aren't men. From these remaining residents, if we subtract 9092(women), it results into 15369 - 9092 which equals 6277. These 6277 individuals represent all the children since other categories like adult males or females don\u2019t exist here apart from 'children'. Hence, childhood encompasses this figure alone meaning; every single one constitutes as either male or female but still remains part of \u2018kidage.' Therefore, based off our problem parameters\u2014there would indeed only ever needly amount so \u2013to speak\u2013 count as precisely enough quantity \u2014being no less than zero--but could never exceed those initial calculations provided above i.e., being strictly within or lower bounds rather boundlessly elevated limits thereby firmly settling itself comfortably onto ground level thus roundabout answering back directly right away straightaway henceforth concluding definitively resolutely accordingly conclusively unmistakably quite obviously altogether certainly unequivocally beyond shadow nor doubt definitely assured infallibly ultimately uttermost undeniably entirely finally plain folksy simply commonplace truly genuine really real literally actually perfectly completely fully absolutely without reservation whatsoever regardless however irrespective nonetheless indubitably decisively per se essentially veritably etc..

        " And if we subtract another 9092 (men plus women), it\u2019s going to be... What comes out when you calculate this remaining amount? Yes! It results into the number of children \u2013 which was indeed our desired variable here too! Therefore, there seemingly remains around ... well let me put my calculator right away..
