        " gumballs, so if we multiply this number by four (four times), it becomes 12*4=48. According to our problem statement 'two plus twenty', which amounts to adding 2+22=24; thus 48 + 24 equals 72, i.e., there would be seventy-two pink gumballs available altogether. Therefore, since no subtraction was specified when dividing into groups or removing any quantity, one can infer all sixty gumballs mentioned belonged specifically to the category identified \u2013pink within the context provided\u2013 hence resulting in exactly seven hundred two individual gumball items under consideration overall but strictly categorized \u2018PINK\u2019.

        " pink gumballs compared to blue gumballs. Let P represent the amount of pink Gumballs (what we want), while B represents Blue gumball which according to this question equals `12`. Therefore our equation becomes :`P=4B+22.` Using substitution we get:`p=(4*12)+22`, so `P=60.` We can conclude here all together. Thus if you look into it your way would result in solving for 'B'. And once again even though its not asked but I believe just providing my approach using these variables make sense especially when trying to find relations like above.\r\rSo what happens next ? Simply subtracting means taking away , addition adding up etc... Well instead let's solve problems using algebra! But hold on before diving head first don\u2019t worry about too complex stuff such equations or derivatives . Start simple right ? First off lets use basic operators available(addition subtraction)(multiplication division) ..
