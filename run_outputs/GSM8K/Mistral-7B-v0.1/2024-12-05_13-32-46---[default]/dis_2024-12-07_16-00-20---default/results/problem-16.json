        " traveled directly West for 80 miles during one day. During the second day it moved North another 150 miles. This makes up only half (vertical or horizontal) line representing its path over this period using Pythagoras theorem we calculate hypotenuse as follows; SQRT(80^2 + 150^2)=approximately=173. I can say based off contextual knowledge roughly about mileage per hour which would make sense if asking something along these lines so let us assume hypothetically lets call average speed X mph hence overall Total_Distributed= Distance+Distance*X , meaning our new Hypothetic formula looks like ; ~~Hypotenuse~~=(Total_distributed)/sqrt{2}\u2248distance/1.41 approximately due to assumption hypothesis made .

However, since you want individual mileage calculation which doesn\u2019t make sense here because it mixes concepts together; considering only linear progression along single lines would lead us to add those values directly due to their nonintersective paths i.e., parallel movement across different planes/dimensions not overlapping but still connected via shared origin point 'San Rafael'.
