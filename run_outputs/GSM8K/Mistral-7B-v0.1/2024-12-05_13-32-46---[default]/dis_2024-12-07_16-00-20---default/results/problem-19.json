She also walked the next two miles in one hour, making it half mile per minute or 0.5 mph as we can compute this through dividing the 2miles/hour by minutes converted into hours (.5=1/.5). To find out if she needs any further acceleration during the last part of her hike while maintaining exactly 4 mph overall take our original goal amount(total travelled path length)-how fast you went before-(hours spent), divide resulting figure over restaining period needed until reaching destination(-[original target minus all previous accomplishments]/all required additional timespans)(which results equal your current pace multiplied against their duration [the same value across whole board], thus yielding correct result when inputted anywhere else besides just here!

Lastly compute Speed via Remaining Distance divided by said Needed Hours Spent; doing opposite multiplies Resultant Fare Rate times Target Period concludes Elapsed Interval\u2014both terms signify unvaryingly identical values due to their reciprocal nature relating to temporal calculation operations discussed prelude section.
