        " relationship identified earlier tells us that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond\u2019s jewels (who has 40), so let\u2019s calculate this first. Half of Raymond's Jewel count would equal \\( \\frac{1}{2} \u00d7 40 = 20\\) . Hence according to our statement \u2013Aaron > Halved_Raymond+Extra_jewels which translates mathematically as J(A) > (\\(\\frac{N(R)}{2}\\))+(E).
