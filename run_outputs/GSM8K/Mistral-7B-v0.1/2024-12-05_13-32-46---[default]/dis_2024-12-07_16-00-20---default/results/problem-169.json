        " miles (from Monday through Friday). Additionally, since Saturday and Sunday are considered as one group which doesn\u2019t count within normal walking hours but counting it only once, this adds up another set of distances i.e., 10 miles times twice; thus adding extra distance counted doubled because both Saturdays or Sundays happen together, therefore taking away part of earlier calculation namely 1*5=25+10*(weekend)=20 so finally having overall considering entirety of seven consecutive calendar weeks would mean totalling sum including weekly incremental increase of mileage along single trajectory hence resulting following computations being equal to 5(Monday till friday) plus additional doubling effect caused over lap involving same direction movement across dual time spans representing separate calender unit ,i.e.; addition of calculated values obtained individually based upon above deduced facts expressed sequentially leading towards logical derivation culminated into concluding figure presented below accordingly ; first calculating individual segments separately & subsequently aggregating them cohesively via analytical synthesis methodology thereby yielding accurate numerical valuator applicable herewith expressive narrative elucidating rationale behind arithmetic calculations conducted pursuant outlined objectives stated previously :total computation equates amount represented numerically translating said verbal explanation translated quantitatively consequently arriving conclusion illustrated subsequent expression confirmingly delineating essence encapsulated initially enunciated purposeful discourse initiate proceedings commence execution begin sequence undertaking systematised implementation executing instructions followed comprehensively observed ensuring precise accuracy alignment harmony adherance consistency maintain steadfastness integrity observe protocol abide guideline conformity observational rigor uphold standardisation excellence assurance thoroughfare validity credibility scrutiny verify results validate proof demonstrate merits warrantability evidence substantiate affirm corroborate claims authenticate legitimacy bolster confidence assert reliability fortify sureties sanction testimonial strengthen conviction ratified certification authorized acknowledgment officially established approved formally recognized conceded consent acquiescent approval accord accepted reconciled resolved settled concluded documented recorded confirmed verified trustworthy believable plausible assured convincing reputable commendable laudable recommend worthy respectable dependable reliable genuinely realistic sound reasoning defend rational argument persuasively argue effectively justify logically reasonably construct compelling support solid case build cogent line of thinking present clear analysis draw inferences make conclus",
        " miles per day but we need this amount over three times (Monday through Friday). That would mean : 20*3= 60 mi/week . However Pancho only counts Wednesdays as one additional walking day so it means , during those four other weekend days( Saturday or Sunday) plus Monday to Thursday ) which equals also Four walking Days since no mention was made about not walking all Saturdays etc...)   To find out these distances, take into consideration firstly 10 miles every single saturday & sunday thus equaling;      Saturday+Sunday Distance                            Total Distance      10x2   20mi           Remaining WeekDays distance              Day TOTAL DISTANCE                Mon       20 Mi               Tue       20 M          Wed        20 Mi             Thu     +20 Mi            FRI       +20 Mi",
        " course of Monday through Friday (which totals up as 'x times'), this equates to Pancho walking 20*x=Miles_weekdays. But if we consider one extra mile walked during breakfast or dinner breaks ('y') it turns into Miles_weeksdays+Y). Adding these together gets us :   Meters_wkendais(5)+Miles_Weekdays+Y)==Total_miles_in_a_week; Substituting values yields 5*(20) + ((20*7)-20)*1+(5)(1)=Days*Rate-(Extra)_per_Day=(number_of_days)*(distance traveled every normal working_day),(extra)/NumberWorkingDays=(DistancewalkedonNormalBreakTime/NoOfWorkingDays); ",
        " adds up to 20*5= <<20*5=100>>100 miles. Since he only doubles back (walking one fifth) during the weekend i.e., 2 extra days; hence it accounts for another ten miles which means Pancho goes walking over 100+10=. His average daily distance walked amounts to . But we already calculated these steps without having used any complex algebra or mathematics formula since no variable was involved here so nothing complicated can possibly go wrong , but rather just doing arithmetic computations based upon provided data points. Therefore considering all facts above I believe what actually needs calculating here would best fit into basic math skills while still maintaining simplicity as requested initially thus eliminating possibility towards requiring something outlandishly sophisticated enough potentially trigger unnecessary confusion making further attempts less likely succeed efficiently despite being possible if desired highly specific instructions not explicitly defined previously nor mandatory thereby rendering them irrelevant under current context directly contradictory logical reasoning against such extreme measures avoidance also due general assumption guidelines stating 'simple explanation first preferred approach unless stated otherwise explicit instruction demand complexity'. No need additional calculations beyond straightforward understanding requires knowledge fundamental basics regarding averaging simple addition multiplied accordingly taking everything factor considered together yield result presented earlier therefore concluding process finished correctly fulfills requirements appropriately satisfying initial ask request properly completing necessary actions expected completion scenario successfully reached satisfactory conclusion ensuring clarity overall satisfaction achieved ultimately goal fully accomplished enjoyment received outcome pleasant experience shared joyful triumph celebration enjoyed rewards awarded success attained happiness gained pleasure delight appreciated accomplishment recognized achievement commemorative occasion celebrated merriment acknowledged festivities exchanged gifts reciprocated gift exchange participated heartily gladly participate again sometime soon look forward meeting friends next get time socialize join gather activities attend parties throw dinner invite colleagues host barbecue grill joint cook supper potluck community meal share food fellowship laughter camaraderie build bonds new friendships create memories cherished forever lastingly impact lives enriches human connections deepens meaning relationships form stronger emotional supports develop trust companionship reliability loyalty fosters love promotes affection care respect kindness empathy compassion solidifies foundational roots bond forms unbreakable steel connection becomes permanent fixture life creates lifelong legacy friendship etched indelibly onto hearts soul leaves imprint everlasting mark never fades away leaving profound impressions deeply rooted personal values principles",
        "*5=100 miles (for Monday through Friday). During the entirety of Saturday and Sunday combined, he only takes one trip out so it\u2019ll add another ten miler making him go 10+10(weekend) equals twenty additional mile over the full seven calendar days totalling us back again to our hundred plus twentythus Pancho travelled seventy two or simply speaking twice fifty as both numbers share same magnitude order which we use less characters if possible while also having equal weightage hence no reason why you couldn\u2019t state either though technically your method still works using short forms but prefers clarity overall leading me towards stating explicitly what I mean without assuming second language speakers fully comprehending technical jargon/terminology like abbreviated versions often found online especially within text messages etc..
