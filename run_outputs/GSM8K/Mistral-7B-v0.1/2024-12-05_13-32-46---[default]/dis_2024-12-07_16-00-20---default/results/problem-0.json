        " Subtract what she uses/eggs sold; subtract her consuming (dinner) plus those used making muffin ingredients minus these amounts equals sales. Calculate dinner usage: Two sets of one fried rice requiring two teaspoons of sesame oil times as often over seven nights makes twelve servings needed. Twelve portions multiplied by approximately half an egg results in six eggs consumed during dinner prep weekly. Weekly addition doubles this figure yielding ten eggs spent overall monthly instead of twenty-fourteen or thirty eight using only biweekly calculations based upon seventy percent reduction due recipe doubling reducing costs accordingly producing roughly eleven units less than twice fifty necessary quantity thereby implying eleventh excess inventory available post cooking session before proceeding further into subsequent stages involving purchasing supplies etc .
