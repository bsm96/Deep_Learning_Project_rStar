        " of apples Jenna\u2019s mom picked (20) by . Half means multiplying or dividing something by one fifth (. One divided into it twice). Therefore, if you multiply Jenna\u2019s mum\u2019s amount which is twenty times one third since four fifths would equate sixth while three fifth remain unchanged ,the resultant product represents what portion of whole ten was contributed by jenna thus; twenty divide thirty equals\u2026two. Thusly therefore adding up all those amounts totals forty. You see this because multiplication distributes over addition like so below ; twelve plus eleven add seventy seven hence resulting out being eighty seven when taken together but just break aparting them based upon quantity individualily such that fifteen makes fifty additional summing it off again making overall..twenty five altogether finally rounding down too close due having fractional part removed leaving exactly zero no nothingness only full ones remaining intact still preserving complete integrity without disruptive interference thereby maintaining original state undisturbed throughout duration creating solid framework necessary support structure ensuring reliability performance optimal results guaranteed every time!

        " 2*x (where 'X' represents the amount that Jenna found). Since we know that this equals 20 .So X= 20*. Half means divide , but since I already multiplied it once i can just divide : 20/.5 = 40 This tells us what Mom collected when halving takes place(the first time) But We Need To Add That As Well!! Because They want What ALL Of Them Found.. Let me add them!  20+40 = 60 Bottom line!!! You Just GOT It Right By Going Over The ",

Solving this we get: 2J + self = 20.. or  2(j+m)=20....so j + m = 10...we substitute back into our original equation which was only concerned about what jellaetted ...this time knowing all variables except ourselves We see that if Jenna gets let\u2019s say X .

Since we know her mothers harvest was 20 this means; itself(jennas amount)=  20-(oneAndHalf)*2=8 since all numbers involved here would equal ~8 if you divide them amongst themselves. This means jennas ownership equals   8/(1+1.5) => (the same thing)/((there self)+(other))=>    8 / ((her moms)(she'))==>(itself )= <<8/(1+1.5)=5>>. "
