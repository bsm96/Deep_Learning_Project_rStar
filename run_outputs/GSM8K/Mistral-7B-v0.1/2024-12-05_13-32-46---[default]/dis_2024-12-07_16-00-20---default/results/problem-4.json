        ". That would be (3)(20) or sixteen fifty cups equal sixty-five hundredths of forty thousand seven hundred thirty pennies(dollars). Add together the four cup amounts already fed so far, fifteen plus twenty-five equals forty cups of feed. Subtract this sum, which stands for what was used, into our original result to find out how much is still required. Take your earlier outcome of sixty-five hundredths of forty million seventy pennysthat leaves you onlywithtenseenthousandonehundredpounds minustwosixtyfiftypenntotsomefortytenscorepenceinthis calculation process.

        " all chickens every day (total). But according to question it mentioned only first two servings so subtract those amounts together from this value you computed above; i.e., 60 \u2013 (15 + 25) = 20. Thus the last serving needs just 20 cups! ",
        " 60 (feed needed) - 15 (morning feed already provided) equals 45 cups. Therefore, when you subtract what was also given later in the day i.e.,  25(afternoon), which equates to about half of remaining food needs 45-(25)= 20 cups still required but yet to serve during last time/dinner; therefore , this means we didn\u2019t reach up close into exact division here so it doesn\u2019t satisfy \u2018last cup count requirement.' Finally conclude the rightful quantity under consideration using only available details as follows : Every Chicken requires equal portions across its entire span over period or event duration hence consider overall provision divided among individual creatures while taking away corresponding earlier distribution . Keeping everything else constant except alterations made previously calculated according specific demands makes sense most probable way forward thus arrives solution :- 'Last Feeding Should Be At Least Half Of Total Calculated Needed Minus What Was Already Given,' Translation being -- calculate mean full serving first excluding those consumed initially mentioned above thereby establish foundational datapoint prior multiplication process followed beforehand ; next adjustment post facto subtraction yield approximate figure representing minimum necessary portion due attention rendered towards fairness principle respect shared responsibility amongst cohabitants living together within allocated space / territory governance protocol etc ..
