From here out our focus switches solely towards 'how might one determine whether or not specific transactions influenced said situation', this comes down largely into simple mathematics operations regarding amounts earned & expenditures occurring over time intervals\u2014and specifically when taking note about residual sums!

        " video games costing him 8 x 20= 160 . His remaining balance was enough to add another game which costs less than or equal to (195 - 160) / 20 , so it means only one extra Game could fit into his budget because otherwise it would exceed twice the amount spent already. Therefore we can conclude that he purchased exactly eight Video Games plus one spare leaving out no unused Legos since he didn\u2019t make any purchases apart from what he specified above. Hence if you subtract this last transaction value(from Remaining Money/ Cost per single Unutilized Item \u2013 Candy Bars), It yields us Number Of Left Over Blocks; Which Is Calculated as follows:(Remanining Balance)${195}$-\\({(Cash Spent)}{$160}\\)=${35}$$ {CostPer\\item} =\\dfrac{\\text{(Left Overs})}{\\text{(One Single Not Used Items)}}=\\dfrac{ 35}{20}= \\rm  1.75 $$Since Fractions Do\\nImplicitMeasureForARealLifeObject,\\norNaturalNumberThenOnlyValidChoiceIsIntegerPart=> ${RoundedUp}=\\rm  2 }$$Hence SinceHeBoughtExactlyFivePackagesOfBlockSetAsStatedInQ$(TotalCount)-${PurchasedItems}+${AdditionalItemNotUsedByEndUserWithNoOtherOptionToGofor}=$\\bf\\{LegoSetsLeftUnUtilized\\}\\quad={11}(WhichWouldMatchWhatWeCalculated)}\\,. \\\\ \\end{matrix}$.
