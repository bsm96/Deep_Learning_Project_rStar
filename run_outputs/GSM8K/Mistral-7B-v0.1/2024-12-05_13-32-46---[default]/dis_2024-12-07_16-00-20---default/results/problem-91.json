        " more than Cindy who has four so Marcia has four+two=six pet . Jan , therefore, would have  3x6 = eighteen pets. Altogether (all together ), you add six(Marcia), eight(Cindy) plus eighteen (Jan)= twentyfour Total Pets!  ",
        " out how many pets Marcia has. Since Cindy has 4 pets, Marcia would therefore have 4+2=6 pets (because it\u2019s specified that \u201cMarcia\" has \"two more pets\u201d). To find Jan's numbers we can take multiple of six i.e., Three so multiplying three to marcias pet count; means Jan possesses  3*6(marcias)pets = **18** .To get the combined amount consider all their collective amounts ; which totals up : ***CINDY***[**4****] + [**MARCIA***][*6****]* plus [(***JAN***)[**18****]] , this sum leads us getting overall figures like 4+(6)+(18)=<<4+(6)+(18)=28>> 28..

        " 2 more pets than Cindy who owns 4, so marcia_pets = cindy_pets + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 pets. Now we can calculate jan_pets which equals 3 times the amount of marcia\u2019s pets; therefore it becomes 3*marcia_pets=3*6 pet=18 Pets owned by Jannie since jannie possesses thrice(three)the quantity of margoes animals. Finally, let us sum up all their respective quantities : Total number_of_animals =jan_pets+cindy_pets+marcia_pets = 18+4+6 = 28. Therefore , our solution yields:",

That means Jan\u2019s pet count would be  3*Marcia because it says \u201cthree\u201d so   3\u00d76=18; meanwhile, Total animals equals marcia(six) plus cindy (four) which sums up into twelve . finally add jan(eighteen)+marcia(six)+cindy(four),which results into twenty eight therefore The ",

Adding up all quantities together; getting the sum would result into cindy+marcia+jan which equals 4+6+18 or altogether equaling 28 pets across them.
