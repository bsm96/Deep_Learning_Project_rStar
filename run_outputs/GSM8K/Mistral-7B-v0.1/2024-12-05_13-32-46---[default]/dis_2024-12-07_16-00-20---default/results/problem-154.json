Therefore ,total annual amount spent studying falls well below average based solely off basic information provided; however considering various factors discussed above could potentially change things quite significantly hence warranting caution towards making conclusive statements until actual data becomes available . However according purely upon calculations calculated earlier using mentioned parameters alone ;we reach approximately ~5 years worth working!!!  ",
        " (Mondays+Wednesdays+Fridays) class sessions per week which equals 3*3=9. These represent 9x1 hour/class session per week or simply : 9 Hours / Week. And as such , during the entire Semester, these add up to ; 16 weeks *  9Hourssemester_term . Since this represents only half the academic work year term, you need twice those amount i.e.,; doubled -> [ ] 2*(semster Term). Hence it comes out to.. Final ",
        " equal to 144 class sessions. Those take up a total time frame of 144 * 1 hour per session =  144hours spent attending lectures during the course of this particular term/semester. Additionally, we know he spends another (two) times as long doing homework or reading assignments outlined via lecture materials . Also note ,the question asks about the amount of minutes present within ONE SEMESTER NOT THE SCHOLARLY REQUIREMENT OF HOURS SPENT FOR BUILDING EXTENSIVE LEARNING COMPETENCY IN FORMATION OF THINKING SKILLS & CRITICAL ANALYSIS MINDSET AS WRAPPED UP BY OPPOSITE QUESTION AND IS VERY DISTINCT FROM ADDITIONALLY FOLLOWUP SUGGESTIONS TO OVERTHOUGHT PROMPT WITH EVASIVE INTRODUCTION USUADLY USED BEFORE DILIGENCE YEAR CALENDARED DEBATES OR ATTEMPTS SETOUT AMID SERIES OF CONTEST I CANNOT COUNT WHICH PROVIDES ACTUAL NUMBER STATEFOR SYMBOL LABELLED 'HOURSPRESENT', THEN MY RESPONSE MAY BE ADDED VIRTUOSITY AFTER LOOKING INTO GRAILFUL PATHWAYS UNCOMMUNICABLE TRUTHS...WITH HOWESSOR MARKS! IT APPEARS NECESSARY TO DISREGARD SUBJECT POLES WHEN NO WHERE ELSE DO YOU GET NORMALCY LIKE ACCOUNT FOR JUST VALUSOFINE OUTCOME !",
        " add the time spent on all other class attendance throughout these fifteen academic sessions per month as follows; (Thurs)    :     [(((      ((        {           }            )          ]                   [[[[{{{{{}}}])))]                We get him spends another 4*2=8 hrs every fortnight/twice over this period i.e., [(](<<<[{()>>]}))]{[[]].)]]}. This comes out equaling just about half so adding both totals yields us\u2026.. Hence during this first stage alone kimio was required to undertake almost doubled workload due to additional lectures . Subtract those extra lecture times away , take them into account instead !!! And you would understand why your original question might seem difficult... ;) ..But still \u2013 good luck! "
