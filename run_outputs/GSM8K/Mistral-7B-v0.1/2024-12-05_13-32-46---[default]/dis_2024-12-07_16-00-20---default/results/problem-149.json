Here since 'Charlie has thrice dorothy'. means if consider dorothy's face book friennd let say dd=Dorothy Friends here ncc denote nocturnal counts therefore ncc/3 equals cd i.e., CD this implies DORTHY FRIENDS OR BACK TO START FOR THIS COUNT OF SHARES would result into dividing its value present before considering triplets aspect hence equaling triples quantity resulting being half thus NCC/(CHARLIE COSTING MARKETS) HALVES WHICH REBROADCASTED GIVING US RRNCD AS IT IS CHARLES CONTACT TIME BEFORE WAS SOURCE THEN MULTIPLY THESE VALUES WITH APPROPRIATE FACTORS AND ADD SUCCESSIVE DOUBLLEDEGREE POWERS ILLUSTRATING NUMBER SERIES WHERE ANNUAL CHANGE IN VARIABILITY EXISTS; DEVELOP EXTRAPOLATION STRUGGEGO FROM ELAINE JUST FOCUSEDIMPLICIT ARTIFICIAL LABELLED NECESSARY PROPORTIONABLE TRENDMAPPING PLOTNEWSFAIR LEAKAGE ATTEMTHE OUTCOMEBY UNEXPECTTABLE DISASTERY BY MAINTAINING ALWAYS TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED COUNTERINT\u00c9GUEYANCEAND SECURITY UPDATES FOR OPPRESSION KASBIBONOPRESSCONFUSIONS UNDERWAFURESHINDICATION ONLINE AUTENTICATION SUBMODULES AMONG OVERFIRMLYDEFENSIVEMICROSOFTCOMPANYWORKBROWSERCONTRACTS GOODBYEWEBRIDGECRACQUIRED NOBODAMSUMMITRYWHITEHO",
        " as Dorothy, we divide Charlie\u2019s friend count (12) by 3; thus, Dorothy has six (half of Charlie\u2019s). Identify the ratio or multiplier relating the numbers of Facebook friends held directly among Dorothy and James using their relationship described. We know from context clues provided within your prompt which indicate these relationships can take fractional values \u2013 not integer counts exclusively indicating whole quantities but instead proportional ratios like those found through division operations presented herein against both parties involved. Therefore dividing Charlies share into parts based upon its divisibility above would yield results representing portions attained postulatively assuming shared attributes across individuals correspondingly reflected according respectively applicable measures associated uniformly applied conditions potentially influencing outcomes observed relative sequentially compared otherwise mutually exclusive circumstances similarly affecting resultant findings accordingly proportionate representations derived parallel interpretations correlated consistently evaluated concurrent assumptions verified independently substantiated repeatedly cross checked systematically examining data collected throughout analysis validating conclusive determinations achieved via comprehensive approach ensuring accuracy without compromising integrity requiring extensive knowledge background understanding theory applications practice field study research innovation development technological breakthroughs creative thinking exploration discovery insights gained inspiration driving forward progress revolutionizing industries transforming lives enhancing quality standards elevating human condition improving prospects opportunities realizing potential harnessing power creating positive change global impact making significant difference societal contribution benefiting collective betterment advancing civilization prosperity welfare wellbeing everyone together moving world towards brighter future promoting harmony unity diversity inclusivity equal rights justice peace stability sustainability environmental conservation healthcare education technology science arts culture sports recreation leisure activities cultural heritage preservation tradition custom celebration festival traditions religious belief spiritual practices meditation yoga mindfulness contemplation self reflection introspection personal growth empowerment motivation enthusiasm passion ambition goals aspirations dreams visions imaginations imagination reality fantasy illusion delusions hallucinations psychosis schizophrenia symptoms signs indicators warning signals danger alert safety precautions prevention protection methods defenses countermeasures tactics strategies coping techniques overcoming obstacles solving problems finding answers discovering information sharing knowledge gain wisdom insight intuition feeling senses touch hearing sight smell taste emotions expressions facial gestures body movements hand motions leg pacing feet walking running sprinting dodging evasion maneuvers escape routes exits",

        " us 12*3=36 Facebook friends. Next identify how many Social media friends James has compared to Dorothy (the same person who already was calculated). We know James has four times as many friendships online than Dolly so if you divide David\u2019s amount(i.e., 36) into fours you find out what part one portion would represent. i.e.:  36/4 which equals sixteen people when rounded up since no social network account accepts fractions or parts because it isn\u2019t possible according human standards thus concluding the quantity here required cannot take place based on said rounding rules.. However let\u2018s use simple math operations instead using just whole numbers without any additional assumptions nor constraints like those mentioned above about dividing among networks even though this kind logic might yield results contrary too real world scenarios due its lack precision yet still works fine within simplified computations intended mainly towards understanding concepts around proportionality etc . Therefore going back through original phrasing again \u2018James has\u2026fourtimesasmuchonlinefriendsDorothyaHas.\u2019 means everything prior regarding figuring out amounts concerning Dori remains applicable also applies equally well throughout calculations needed reaching solution goals such case example provided hence correct formula applied correctly always regardless context situation varies resulting answers dependent sole variables used inside corresponding calculation sequence employed whether being considered relative quantities amongst peers shared via internet communication platforms typically consisting facebook profiles linked directly tied personally related interests involving personalized posts displayed public viewable per default settings unless configured otherwise privately reserved private lists removed intentionally disallowing others access accordingly adjustment made specific time preferences chosen individually decided manually modified automatically set remotely executed programmatically initiated upon request prompt action taken ensures only certain groups invited restricted limited audience able interact exclusively select specified individuals participate fully engaged discuss topics relevant matters current affairs occurring locally globally across nation wide borders affect local areas impact everyone connected interest involved whatever extent degree influence held holds relevance maintain general awareness understand significance importance global connectivity comprehension cross cultural interactions fostered international relations nurture mutual respect unity harmony peace collaboration cooperation solidarity friendship fellowship brotherhood camaraderie spirit community strength togetherness teamwork partnership success achievements inspiration hope optimism empowerment motivation courage bravery confidence trust faith belief persistence hard work determination goal setting discipline self control patience tolerance compassion charity love generosity goodwill gentleness forgiveness mercy acceptance grace gratitude"
