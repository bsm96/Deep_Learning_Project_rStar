        " that Brittany\u2019s phone capacity (300) equals the value which represents 'the number of photographs'. And as per provided details this number also means \u2018five times more photos\u2019 when comparing it against our original amount i.e., 1 image taken by Jamal representing a single bird at the Zoo . Hence , dividing backward leads us to find out : Number of animals represented / Counting backwards=Number shown upfront ; Duck count(x)/Photo multiplier (=5)=Original photo size (x).
