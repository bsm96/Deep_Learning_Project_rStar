Each box weighs 15 pounds, therefore if you divide this remaining capacity by the weight per item i.e., 15/pounds; it would yield approximately 82 items(as decimals aren\u2019t valid here). Hence the max amount possible isn\u2019t whole numbers like 'approximately', rather exactly 82 as fractions cannot exist when counting physical objects such as these boxes \u2014 round down because even one extra pound means crossing beyond capacity! As already calculated before based upon division resulting into quotient value being nearer towards integer side without touching fraction parts.(so technically saying) While calculating again just doing straight calculations using mentioned facts could lead us also directly reaching upfront similar solution point though procedure might seem longer time consuming or detailed approachwise speaking compared yet logically arrives same exact resultant outcome ultimately..

Each box weighs 15 pounds, hence the max number would become (remaining capacity / individual item weight) or 1245/15=83. This means up to 83 boxes could safely go across the bridge without breaking its carrying limitations as long every other factor stays constant. Therefore, under these conditions, loading only whole items into the truck ensures safety and avoids risk related damage resulting due heavyweight crossing. The exact quantity rounded down isn't viable since partial weights don't exist practically within this context i.e., you cannot transport part of a box! Hence if precision matters here ensure all variables remain unchanged during calculation process such as initial loads already set forth like vehicle mass etc..
