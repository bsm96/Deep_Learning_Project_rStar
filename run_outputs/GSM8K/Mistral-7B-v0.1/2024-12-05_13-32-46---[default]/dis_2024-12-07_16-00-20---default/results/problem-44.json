        " gross profit per candle would just need dividing this amount through (profit per item). Thus we get 1 dollar profit /candle or ($2-$1)/candle because 10*$(cost/unit*quantity) yields revenue which when minus production costs ($1x2=$2), leaves us our Profit margin calculation yielding 1$.

        " means it costs him .$10 per candle when taking into account both materials ($10 divided among all ten). To find out profits (money made minus expenses), we first need to figure out exactly how much revenue was generated off these twenty products sold; this equals [(($2/candle) \u00d7 amount_produced)] \u2212 supplycostperbatch[(in our case)(= [(($2 /pound)|x|numberofproductsmade)/amount |fromone| batch]). We know already than only half \u2014 or rather eight since there\u2019re 10 produced but doubled here because four would equal twelve instead of sixteen\u2014need actual purchases due oversaturation caused by doubling production quantities twice over throughout calculations thus far so subtract away accordingly.[(([$2\u2009\u00d7\u20098]\u2009\u2212\u2009[($10\u2009\u00f7\u200910)=](=$1\u202f+\u2003${$$2)$))=(~$1)).

        " make 20 candles (since 10 candles per batch require double). At $10/pound, those would cost him $20. Selling these 20 candles at $2.00 apiece brings in revenue of 20*2=40$. His expenses include $20 for beeswax so we subtract this amount from our revenue figure. This leaves us with 40$-20$, which equals $20 as net income or loss, since it represents positive cash flow rather than deficit spending.. However you could also say 'net gain', assuming not all numbers might carry negative connotations regarding profits.\r\r[NetGain(Revenue-$Expenses)] \r",
        " would cost him 2*$10= $20 as materials (supplies). At this point, we know the costs but not yet anything about revenue so let\u2019s see when it starts making sense financially \u2013 here comes our second calculation regarding sale price per item! It says \u201che sells them all\u201d which suggests ALL twenty need getting off trash heap/garbage bucket(?)\u2026and into somebody else homes eventually :P; therefore these go down only once upon buying since nobody likes paying twice otherwise..but wait ah haa! We already paid above just doing bulk discount purchasing ;) Oh yeah right!! Anyway ignoring such details like return rate or whatever because nothing specified...since sales happen first followed immediately afterwards earning happens thus adding extra dimension allowing further understanding potential income stream flows before any deductions affect bottom line amounts\u2013thus far understood quite well ok indeed still thinking carefully considering everything very deeply :) But hold up another minute I seem confused again maybe why mention supply acquisition stages multiple times over repeatedly rather than simply stating directly initial expenses required thereby possibly reducing confusion arising form various interpretations presented earlier henceforth shall definitely clarify exactly aiming clarity achieve fully!!!
