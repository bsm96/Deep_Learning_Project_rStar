These actions pertain to those who didn\u2019t manage to get past the impasse using their initial attempt within these timings; therefore we subtract them as well as the ones opting not to traverse further due to taking alternative routes ('a group... leaving'). This suggests a deduction operation involving subtractions i.e., 'original_count minus arrived during timing one,' less \u2018leaving,\u2019 plus what transpired amidst second timeframe duration\u2014this forms our equation which would look something like `final_result=initial+firstIntervalActionNumber\u2212groupLeft+(secondIntervalActionNumbers)`.

To calculate how many cars remained, subtract those 5 cars that departed early; this leaves us with 30 - 5 = 25 cars still waiting or driving through within their allotted timeframe. As per instructions earlier, during these conditions no additional drivers joined which means we can consider only one group of vehicles moving forward together regardless of when it began as long as the timespan overlaps i.e., both actions happened somewhere inside those initial 15 minutes period. Accordingly figure out what fractional part corresponds to each half minute interval based off our new count thus calculating approximately ((time)/(total available hours)*car value)=((1/15)-hour /1 hour)\u00d7numberofcars=~(1 car every ~2 mins)?

However here it was provided directly as 'originally', which indicates this information doesn\u2019t involve any calculations or additions/subtractions post setup (the existing state before subsequent events). Therefore, since no other group besides those involved in moving out during both periods (first fifteen & last fifteen) existed when calculating movements within just the first period itself, logically all movement occurred prior than mentioned later stages \u2013 i.e., till the point right before breakup caused due to exits. Based solely upon data relating explicitly about quantity changes happening exactly under consideration ('x amount move past'). Hence extracting numbers related specifically pertaining such transit activity reveals immediately; namely -- First wave moves equals full carlist minus following waves plus jersey departures equate resulting thus being sum(carls) - part_of_second+jerseydetravelers=finalized figures emerging precisely regarding early motion trend.
