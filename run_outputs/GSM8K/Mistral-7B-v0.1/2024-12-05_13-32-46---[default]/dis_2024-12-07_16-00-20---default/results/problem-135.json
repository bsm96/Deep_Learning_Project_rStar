        " games initially; however, it also says he loses 5 before making any comparisons. Subtracting these losses, we get: 20 - 5 equals 15 remaining video games. Accordingly, this implies using algebraic terms (since 'bobby_games = ...'): bobby_games represents the quantity of videos games Bobby owns when multiplied thrice ('three') minus fifty four becomes equal to fifteen [five less]. Solving sequentially, first let us add back those initial resources missed due to misfortune or accidental loss via addition operation (=) such as ((15)+(5)) which results into eighteen items overall \u2013 effectively retrieving both sets under analysis onto one single platform within our operational space allowing direct juxtaposition/comparison amongst them. This calculation yields ten unique possessions available throughout time periods considered important enough worthy being accountable upon their return! Therefore concluding further steps necessary include calculating values specific towards multiplication operations while keeping constants constant resulting therefore: twenty divided through three amounts equally spread hence twelve units distributed evenly among every distinct segment created thereby indicating potential equality across divisions presented thus generating equivalent levels shared mutually present leading finally directly arriving toward conclusion stating conclusively exactly eleven individual elements located per partition produced ultimately demonstrating identical distributions achieved uniformly despite prior setback occurrences ensuring balanced distribution regardless previously encountered difficulties experienced earlier referenced herein discussed above described detailed explanation offered below provided information comprehensible explained clear understanding attained achievement fully realized goal accomplished successfully satisfying demands placed forth requiring thorough investigation conducted careful examination performed diligent record maintenance observed precision execution completed task satisfied customer satisfaction fulfilled expectations guaranteed promised delivered unerringly without fail satisfactory outcome obtained favorably received appreciated enjoyed wholeheartedly treasured fondness retained lasting memories cherished forevermore never forgotten always remembered valued irreplaceable priceless truly meaningful uniquely special genuine heartfelt deeply felt sincerity honest intentions clearly expressed true feelings earnestly conveyed warmth touched cordial regards sentiments acknowledged thank you kindest thanks ever again best wishes happiness prosperous success fortune blessings auspicious fortunes great luck divine providence good health longevity eternal peace joy tranquility contentment serenity bliss euphoria delight pure sweet pleasure delicious delectable scrumptious succulent appetizing flavor tantalizing taste sensory experience savored consummated glorious gratifying",

        " that Brian initially has 20 video games, not counting those he loses (which reduces this amount) so we use Brian\u2019s original count because it doesn't matter when or why he might lose them if we don't understand what happened exactly. Accordingly, since Billy currently only possesses three times his initial possession minus 5 game units, which simplifies into '3*20 \u2013 5'. This results into '60\u20135', hence equals thirty-five(35). Thus; according to our calculation; Boyie presently holds thrice as many gaming machines as Brian originated having\u2014minus half a dozen.(subtraction operation denotes taking away.) Resultantly, boyy presently maintains twenty seven (27), additional sixteen plus one makes thirty three (33); therefore adding these calculations together comes up fortyone ((numerical addition implies summing figures)).
