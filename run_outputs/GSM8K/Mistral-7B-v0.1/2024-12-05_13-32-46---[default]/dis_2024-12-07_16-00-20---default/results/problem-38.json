Therefore if you look back again, since we know it\u2019s three different distances but always totals up this way; Monday would be around 7miles(about when I rounded), Tuesday ~6miles Wednesday approximately ~5miles Adding these together confirms the original distance covered which was roughly close enough to  6.67*x+y=60 , y can also be considered just like Saturday& Sunday here being average mileage . Hence your previous answers aren\u2019t necessarily incorrect because depending upon what methodology u use while solving math problems sometimes rounding errors might appear hence its recommended anytime taking care calculating values carefully!

Let H represent speed so we know this formula works out because Distance=Speed*Time which means when you multiply them together it equals distance but since its not stated what type of unit time was used lets just assume its minutes here instead normally these equations use seconds or even milliseconds due to their small value . But if one hour consists off sixty minute(same amount goes into another hr)and three hrs equal ninety mins.(a quarter extra min compared to our initial assumption)so using those calculations alongwith knowing thathe ran thrice duringweekhis equation looks like; Totalhoursrunoverthreeworkdays=(Hoursfirstworkout+hourstwootherafter)+((half)(hourseightwoftimefortwoblackouts))+(again(halfxtimefourblackouts))...now simplify all terms before proceeding furtherto solveforfinalanswerwehaveTotalminutesinplaceofmoments/speedwhereourinitialcalculationsare:[totalmions]=[numberoftimesworking*(howmanyhrsaheadonyoursecondorthirdworker)]...thereforeifyousolvetotalmonsidedistancethenyourtimesdoneshouldmatchuponbothendsasitmustalwaysdobecausetheresnothingstoaccountforspeedingduringthisperiodbeyondthepuremathfactorthatdetermineseverynththingthroughputterbutsinceitsonlyknownoffoundatconclusionherewhatimaskingisjustwhetherrunningalongsideanotherpersonwillresultineveryonegettingarounddistanceproportionateinthemoreperfectlybalancedmannersthatdoesnotnegativelyinfluenceanyonesrunningwithoutcompromisingsomebodiesotherparticipantspacewhilealsoensuresanaccuracybasedanalysisbetweenallresultscomparisoncanbegineasefullyaccordingtowhoarrivedearliestgivenwholeftlateretceteraevenwhenindicatedfactsfactorgiveaproxyformassestimateusingavailableinformationincludingspecificdetailsintotheproblemsuchcasedoorareainsidebuildinglocatorusedaboveexamplesitekeywordsseveraltakenintoconsiderationdependingsonneededdetaillevelexampleincludebasicinfoaboutlocationphysicalenvironmentconditionshistorycontactpreviouslyprovideddatashouldsufficeablyclarifysubjectquestionuntilmoreappropriatelynecessaryadditionaldataallowableaddingnavigationalguidepostscouldservehelp",

That would mean these last(remaining)miles get spread out amongst him equal amount; therefore . We know he covered 3Hours+xhours=Total_time spent Running ; This simplifies down To , Because Hourly Rate doesn\u2019t Change throughout the Week or any Day \u2013 Given : Run Distance Covered Every Morning\u00d7Run Time Taken Outside All Other Days=(Day Two Mileage)(Second Half Of Second Day)+etc\u2026 Therefore Total Time Spent Running Equals ..
