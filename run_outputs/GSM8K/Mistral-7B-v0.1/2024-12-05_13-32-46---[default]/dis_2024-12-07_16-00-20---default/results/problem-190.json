        " Since John collected peaches at the rate of 2 per minute, it means 180 (minutes) times 2(peaches/minute) equals the amount of peaches collected; this works out as follows: 180*2=360 peaches. Hence the solution is justified because all calculation steps follow sound mathematical rules without violation or contradiction.

        " there\u2019re (a) What happens when you subtract seven sevenths minus six fifteenths using fraction bars or pie charts? Explain your reasoning steps. Solutions: Step by Step Explanation Using Pie Charts To visualize subtraction involving fractions like sevens and fifties, we first need to represent these quantities through piecewise divisions\u2014such as circles which act as pies divided into equal slices. Here's what this might look like visually and mathematically:Step 1: Drawing Fraction Bars/Pie Charts Start by drawing three whole units side-by-side since our original quantity starts with 'seven wholes'. Each unit represents something divisible equally; imagine them being cut such that four parts form one complete circle. These sections symbolise quarters. Two third portions out of those quarters mean approximately \\( \\frac{8}{12} \\) (\\( \\frac{3 \\times 4}{4 \\times 3} \\)) considering every full quarter was made up of twelve sixths so simplifying brings us back to \\(\\frac{3 }{4}\\), but keeping the common denominator makes calculations easier.Visual representation implies having three circles representing my initial amounts (in simplified notation above).To illustrate different shapes used here aren't actually necessary because equivalent representations still convey identical values during operations \u2013 regardless whether presented linearly via columns&columns lists across rows &rows panes boxes containing numerators only\u2013or circular graphs segmentated horizontally along circumferences perimeter areas corresponding various levels ratios ratio sizes relative magnitudes magnitude multipliers proportional relationships proportionalextent degrees angles lengths sides length dimensions dimensionless scalar metrics multidimensional scaling space vectors vector fields spatial distributions field mappings coordinate transformations map projections geospatial analysis cartographic mapping methods quantitative data analysiessignaling processing network topology digital signal transmission communication systems telecommunications infrastructure networks satellite broadcast signals radio frequency spectrum electromagnetic waves wave propagation light refraction reflection imagery radiometric techniques remote sensing photogrammetry image interpretation radar interferometry GIS Geographic Information Systems computer vision artificial intelligence neural networks pattern recognition machine learning algorithms statistics statistical inference probability theory hypothesis testing models regression analysis causal inferences correlation cointegration forecast model evaluation evaluative frameworks qualitative assessment criteria subjective perspectives objective evidence empirical observations experimental procedures peer review processes ethnography case studies observational study naturalistic observation archival research literature reviews systematic reviews",
