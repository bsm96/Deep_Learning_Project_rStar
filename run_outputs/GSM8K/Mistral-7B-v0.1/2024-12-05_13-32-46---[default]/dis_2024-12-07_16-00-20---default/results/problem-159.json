Hence why although numerically my initial calculation might seem off because considering every individual entity rather individually counts twice towards summing up your collective observation group; yet practically speaking \u2013 no single living thing goes unnoticed especially due diligence required during aquatic creature identification sessions like mine!

Therefore , presently we\u2019re observing just 15 froglets active within our field observation window as per current scenario descriptions provided earlier before any motion shifts (which could potentially affect numbers).
