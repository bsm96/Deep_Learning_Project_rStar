        " bikes at 'feet/minute'. We convert Steves trip length (miles) into feet since we need common units which means converting 3 miles \u00d7 5,280 (since one mile equates to around 5,280 ft). This works out to about  15,840 feet. Next lets identify all other values needed, but first set up ratios using time as variable , speed divided equals distance over amount of minutes .

        " Convert this into feet since both speeds provided are in foot/minute (since we need common units). We know that one mile equals approximately 5280 feet; therefore, multiply 3 miles by 5280 feet/mile getting us approx. 15840 feet which represents the biking duration needed if speed was constant but it varies based upon cycling effort. This scenario assumes uninterrupted travel without stops or delays during transit hence no rest interval time involved within these calculations.

Therefore when he reaches home time wise he still needs no wait as nobody else comes yet or arrives while steves not back home meaning all other competitors lose because tim never catches up to him thus making Steve win.

        " rides three miles towards his house, this means it took him (3*12) or 36 minutes to reach his destination back from school. Similarly, since time equals distance over rate and knowing both rates equally coverable into hours instead of seconds; Tim covers twice as far while moving slower . It would therefore take Tim half again such amount , thus arriving in about ((36)/(2*(2/3)))=or roughly  27 minutes rounded off . To find out if Steve wins firstly compare speeds : speed ratio equalizes distances covered which turns around average speeds covering same amounts being equivalent ; hence dividing these initial times we obtain Steve winning margin within ((36)-(27)) = 9 mins approximately rounding here downwards when calculating timings involves approximations not exact values ..Thus Steve gets home nearly instantly but still keeps pace till reaching closer areas whilst holding up less delay overall comparing totals compared to slowmoving counterparts despite potential losses faced initially upon starting point.. Timewise meaningful though minimal differences appear nonetheless important considering human interaction perspectives regarding sportsmanship vs competition ethics versus mere objectivity based solely logic centered decision making methods involving quantifiable data parameters only without subjective considerations taken during real life context scenarios often requiring qualitative analyses beyond raw numerical representation levels alone !

        " minutes to reach home. Similarly, since Tim rides at 264 ft./min., it would take him  5,280 / 264 = roughly 20 minutes (exactly) to cover a distance of 1 mile. Therefore Tim covers exactly 2*20=40 mins which means this guy crosses over even ahead! It doesn't actually matter how far Steves gets because we know tim makes it back faster. We could find out if wanted though; just plug these values into our formulae above... One thing I neglected was conversion factor needed here--it wasn\u2019t necessary but my mind keeps thinking all those calculations involve seconds rather than real time passed through hourglass etc.. But let me correct myself about speed units later when you ask why convert them again ;-) My original assumption based upon provided information says both athletes meet right smack midway regardless whether going towards ORAING OFFICES ON BEACH STREET . That isn \u2019 s quite convenient !

As such no clear duration was provided regarding starting times\u2014nor ending time once arrived via respective transportation methods hence my assumptions may skew accuracy slightly but still aim toward reasonable approximation assuming 'start immediately upon completion; same pace till stopping point reached'.
