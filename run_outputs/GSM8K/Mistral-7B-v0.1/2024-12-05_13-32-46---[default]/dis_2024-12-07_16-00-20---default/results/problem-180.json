        " (3/4) x 80 = <<(3/4)*80=60>>60 votes. Because all votes went either to candidate one or two equally only if both received exactly half as mentioned earlier it would not result into whole numbers thus we consider fractional votes which leads us using denominator four so dividing them separately results in winning_vote = floor((total_votes*winner_ratio)/denominator). Using above formula provides you same value wich suggests integer division however this doesn\u2019t account out fractions hence needs modification like below:   winning_vote += math.floor((winning_share*(denominator+n))) / denominator**where n represents remainder resulting when distributing decimal points among numerators whose ratio corresponds closest towards their target values while keeping sum constant .
