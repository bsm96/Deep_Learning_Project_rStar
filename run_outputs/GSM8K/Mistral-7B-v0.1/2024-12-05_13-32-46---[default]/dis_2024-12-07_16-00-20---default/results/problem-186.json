Additionally, if n represents the unit equivalence factor such that every group counts separately regardless of potential overlaps, which seems logical here without further context specifying otherwise, it results into effectively multiplying our initial calculation; i.e., accounting equally either way wouldn\u2019t change result because adding those identical halves back would cancel out itself anyway due to conservation principles implied thus not altering overall figures relevant initially introduced \u2013 just doubling them simply means using both sides together rather than treating like elements uniquely hence making no difference whatsoever besides potentially leading confusion through misrepresentative language choices but essentially nothing substantial changed aside purely numerical manipulation involving same terms involved elsewhere before computation began therefore leaving us unaffected even though wordy explanation could make impression different outcome being mistaken somehow possibly seen below instead...",
        " so this leaves us (160 - 20) / 6=26\u2154 or around 26/7 which means about 4 rats per group as we cannot distribute partial items like half piece of food etc., As only full numbers exist naturally it would mean no decimal fractions exists hence rounding off any non whole value into either higher integer or lower than present nearest values ie; Lower bound ~= floor function(~nearest smaller integers.) Given here ,we can say there may not exactly match but closest fitting scenario could include having '27' animals instead i.e.; assuming 5 crates altogether containing approx \u201827\u2019 numbners allotted evenly over them..ie .approx.(cube_root[(total nubmer)/group size]).Thus one way possible solution : Russell worked out best case approximation! Thus according to above information considering least close option provided within constraints & based upon assumption stated earlier lets go ahead assume its almost perfect distribution nearer rounded up thus leaving possibility open still despite exact details unknown due uncertainty involved such assumptions required till additional info found available ..Also note situation mentioned assumes individual feedings occurrences same frequency daily throughout weekdays across board thereby increasing totals cumulatively month wise providing clearer perspective further investigation needs while adjustment considerations remain flexible adaptive factors possibly affect change dynamics accordingly ; implying better accuracy preferred yet practical necessity often necessitates using estimation techniques when exact figures elude certainty \u2013 useful generalizations arise particularly during initial stages planning prior definitive data collection methods established...

        " went to all the rats combined. Since we subtract this from the total amount (which was 160), it remains 160 - 18 = 142 pounds of straw going only towards hammers, guinea pigs, and baby rabbits because no other animals get any.

        " straw are used for the hamsters. To find out if all these add up correctly we can sum them together which results into 18+50=68 pieces of straw being accounted for (minus the ones going towards rabbits) . But no other places use any straw but the one mentioned above , this means every bit was properly allocated i.e.,  160-(the count not used toward rabbits)=(straw quantity assigned to smaller animals)-pieces taken away from previous calculation=(total amount subtracting counted part)+rats per group=.So accordingly,(Total Straw Count available -(Straw Quantity AssignedTo SmallerAnimals))+(RatsPerGroup)*NumberOfGroups equals Total Amount UsedForSmaller AnimalsSince it\u2019s stated Russell distributes 160 piece amongst smaller rodent beds and only those amounts matter,, since when dividing over several rooms or sets of things you need their totals first before assigning individual counts ..
