Since these values don\u2019t cancel out as expected due to their differences indicating inequality rather than equality, I can conclude nothing about whether or not Thursday produced greater income relative to other dates considering previous results cannot help us find difference in numbers yet when combined differently might provide additional insight..

        " truck tires. This means the amount charged can only come from car tire prices which was calculated as (12*40)=480 dollars. Comparing these revenues; we find out 720-$480=$240. Hence, the mechcian earned $240 more on one particular day than another. ",
        " 6 times this amount equals (6*60) which comes up as $360. Similarly, each car tire would cost him ($40/car)*(number_of_cars)=$40*(6 cars)+($40/(trx))*$4=($240+$160). Combining both totals we get ((360+240)=$600), so thus far on Wednesday alone; Monday\u2019s high was $600.

Next Monday, the mechanic makes only from work related to fixing up passenger vehicles because no semi\u2019s showed off until Saturday afternoon so I am going to say it was zero which may or may not be true but if you just look here what we need would probably include those small things like brakes etc... Here since this question says nothing about costing per service such as oil change; air pressure checks/tests nor even whether these services could impact vehicle resale value either positively OR negatively our assumption therefore leads us directly straight forward into understanding \u2018car owners love payments! \u2013\u2013 don\ud83d\udcb0so why bother trying ? \u2019 However , according above information provided clearly shows both cases equal prices overall due very little details present including price variance differences mentioned thereby making calculations quite straightforward hence providing accurate financial analysis result .
