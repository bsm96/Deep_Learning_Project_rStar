During the second month, she collects 20 lesser than what she accumulated during the prior one; hence she gets another set containing 60 - 20 = 40 cards. Consequently, this adds up all her collection so far as being 80(previous count including initial ones) + 40 (second month\u2019s card acquisition), making it equal to 120 cards altogether. Finally, if we note down February deposits alongside January sums yields us  60+40=100, multiplying them provides double the summed values i.e., 100*2 = 200.
