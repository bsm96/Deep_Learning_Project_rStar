        " ones, she initially has 80 + 18 = 98. When she distributes one per ledge among them as gifts, it reduces the count by another 40 (because all those leadages would receive one).

Thus, when Mary finishes distributing these extraledgments with freshly gathered saplings next weekend, she retains only half of what remains i.e., around approximately  0 or no significant difference compared to before due to rounding off numbers during computations.(This part assumes hypothetical scenario because theoretically speaking individual gift can vary depending upon random selection.) Therefore considering both scenarios independently without assuming any change post yesterday\u2019s accumulation \u2014 Post yesterday addition if rounded down implies zero remaining but realistically shouldn\u2019t drop below single decimal digits like ~5 following deductive deduction based strictly over arithmetic principles rather than speculated implications linked within problem statement hinting towards \u201cgenerous\u201d disposition indicating potential increase beyond simplistic subtractions hence resulting into non integer division case potentially suggesting mid way through distributions leading somewhere near original state pre &post yesterdays additions.).

That equates to ~58 plants when rounded down. Therefore if you subtract all those she distributes meaning removing both previously existing ones perledage and the additional incoming [total planted]*[number of distributed] being roughly calculated through this formula : Remaining Potted Plants~Original+Distributed-(Received)(Given Out)=Remaining^Amount=. As such our calculation becomes like thusly : ~58+(18x40)-((1/Ledge)*Total Distributed).

However next morning when she takes down one per shelf or place which was present previously because it could occupy too wide space leaving no sufficient gap for freshly delivered flowers \u2013 those would leave only thirty seven places remaining empty but still keep all others intact since taken away once again! Thus finally we may write them mathematically as follows considering single unit containers having size greater than any other item being moved hereafter:- Total items required including extra spaces outside boxes=- All things considered above calculated earlier-> Pots needed before distributing over homes\u2019 terraces along walls/floors during moving out stages can become(excess)- No further reduction involved except keeping count until proper transfer occurs -> [No specific value mentioned]. Hence based upon logic alone knowing precisely what remains depends heavily both prior actions performed henceforth anticipated activities occurring subsequent proceedings alongside overall plans made thus far etc..

        " she wants to give away one from each which means she would give off 40 (one per each ledge). Subtracting this amount from the original count yields us 80 - 40 = 40 remaining plants. Plus, remember yesterday she also acquired additional flowers, so we add those as well. Therefore finally it sums up to  40 remaining ones plus the newly arrived bunches i.e.,   40+18= 58 plants. Thus if you rephrase that last sentence using numbers only without explanation or punctuations but instead just adding together like 'total_plants = plats_already_owned + freshly_acquired'. You get :",

We know one person per every single countertop receives exactly only one piece thus altogether if all counters receive these presentations ,we find ourselves subtracting those numbers out resulting into : Total count=Initial NumberOfCounters-(NumberGivenOnEachCounter)=(initial No_ofcounters)-NoGoerPerLedge=(sumFromabove)&Final",
        " windows so this means she\u2019ll subtract 40 (for all those missing) which makes it equal to  40 potted plants less than what was before. To find out exactly how many remains :   80 initial amount \u2013       (40 removed flowers per location*1)=           80-40=         Remaining amount     Therefore , MARY WILL STILL HAVE 80 POTTED PLANTS AFTER GIVING BACK TO EACH LADDER SO ONCE..!!! No worries you said no numbers not letters I mean... well okay let me try again! We need firstly count one side only remember its told us shes doing like FIVE times as often here(i.e.) 'on TUESDAY':      Friday starts next week Monday needs another example too right so lets use Thurdsays last Wednesdays planters but skip over sun/ mon & Fri since nobody works them cause off hour stuff anyway just put Sat& Sun also . Hmmm Saturday doesnt work either because most places dont open till about ten AM anyhow maybe late afternoon could go back down once early am might fit if i say somethin around sixish hours wouldnt hurt cuz even morning folks sometimes start later during summer months plus lotsa people take their breakfast while watching TV etc though nites usually better sleeping time especially near summers heat waves yaddaa additonal info needed still trying however.....soooo gimme good luck mannnn....think hard u cant mess up im pretty sure whatever happens ill always get ur point across somehow okie dokies my bad misspeaking sryyaaar !!!

Tomorrow when she removes one pot per shelf; removing all those would make it minus(1*40)= <<40*(-1)=-40>>-40 which leaves us with    98+ (-40)        =<<98+(-40)=58>>58 remaining among the newly collected ones only without mentioning about old existing collection because we didn't subtract out these original numbers yet . Finally , adding back what remained untouched results into   58+(80-40)               =<<58+(80-40)=98>>98 stay as our answer. Thus rechecking initial counting isn't needed here since no info was provided regarding removal/departure outside the context stated above making direct computation simpler & less prone errors but if such details get mentioned next time its best not just stick onto calculations directly instead factor account adjustments based on specific situation changes like removals discussed earlier hence avoid overlapping error corrections unlike this scenario.

As soon as next time if Mary distributes one flower pot per windowsill ,the remaining no. would equal ((98)-(40))=58 flowers so here we take all those mentioned situations considered together but ultimately only ask about what remainder flora stays i.e.(98-(a collection containing forty small items)=fifty eight ) this means finally Mary remains holding up fifty four plastic containers full of greenies inside them!

We just need also consider yesterday\u2019s additional contribution which was further increase into equation since its being used along side existing stock count towards distributable resource pool hence:(existing resources including last purchased)+new purchase amount/(no_ofslots)=final sum ((original)*quantity+(lastPurchase))/NoOfSlots=(40*2+18)/40=.98which rounds up too making result non negetive therefore finally leaving us wiith ..[((original)*Quantity)(Last Purchased))]-(Distributed Number)[Explanation](We took original no., distributed nuber & newly procured products .Subtracting Distribtion Count makes Sure enough resulting value Non Negative otherwise you could make roundup while calculating average but u might loose few items here.)
