Since we know full priced pairs alternate within our purchase scenario, we can count just half plus whole numbers to get their cumulative effect through time/steps -- so instead of doing all fifteen calculations manually like above : Pair ",
        " problem also tells us it\u2019ll cost him just sixty percent or (6/10) which simplifies as follows;    $${6\\over 10}=\\frac{3}{5}$$ so we simplify this fraction further to get ${{\\frac {6}{10}}\\times \\frac{{1}}{}\\times {\\frac{5}{}}={}3}$ Thus, when priced using fractions rather than decimals, the discount would look like following ;$$\\frac{3 }{${$}*{\\frac{5}{}}=3$$, thus each cheaper pair prices as such . Determine if any pairs exist among those 16 items. Counting out multiples allows you identify sets within larger totals. Herein counts , since half equals eight meaning four full setups can fit into sixteen items ($$[8+8=16]$$). Given said subsets contain whole numbers representing individual products, twelve unique combinations equate equal fifteen distinctive units combining both regular sales unit(n)and their corresponding sale version(${$}[5+3=\\text normal+\\text discount={\\color{green}{\\underline{{}}}unit}])$$. Therefore calculating summed value entails multiplication followed up against quantity determined priorly.

        " its original cost which calculates as follows; 0.6*($5)=$3 per regular priced (odd) pair of these so we find out their individual prices when grouped together ($5+$3). This means pairs consistently amount to $(5+3=)$8 collectively or (($(8/2)=)$$4$) individually within this discount context. Determine what quantity represents full pairs. We know Kylar purchased sixteen pairs therefore calculating eight sets separately. Finally calculate your result based upon set calculations. Eight groups consisting of four items implies multiplying our unit value identified previously across all twelve members combined resulting into multiplication following below sequence ;(n)(x) equals product hence grouping matters because certain elements appear multiple times during summation meaning if you group similarly composed parts it becomes easier solving problems dealing specifically w/ arithmetic sequences like those mentioned above namely repetition counting principles . Thus ,total revenue would equate thusly:(number_of_sets)_*(price_per_set);or equivalently,(quantity_acquired)/_(items_in_pair)*(_costing entirety),which finally evaluates down here :((NumberAcquired / ItemsInPair)) * (_CostOfEntireSet)).So simplifying yields us :(numerator/_denominator )_* _pricing_.Thus substituting appropriate values presented earliery leads towards equation resolution viz :(TotalPriceCollected := (QuantityAcquired / SetSizeValue ) * CostPerFullPricemarket)Or mathematically represented :- Total Price Collected Equals Quantity Acquired Divided By Set Size Value Multiplied By Full Market Pricemarketc...Finallysubstitutingallgivenvaluesleadsto solutionfinalizedfollowingly:-Final",
