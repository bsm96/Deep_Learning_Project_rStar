Since it was stated that Dylan bought '6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages', we can figure this out as follows; add the extra amount (which was six) to the initial quantity which makes 38+6=44. Having figured out both quantities separately let\u2019s combine them together into one single whole sum namely adding these amounts up i.e., 38(chicken)+44(fish). This yields us a combined value equivalent to  38+44=82 Thus our summation shows , hence making clear through calculation steps mentioned above .
