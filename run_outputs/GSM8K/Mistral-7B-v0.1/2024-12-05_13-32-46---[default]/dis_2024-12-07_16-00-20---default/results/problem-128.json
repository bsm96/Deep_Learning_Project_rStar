To summarize ; Cost Of Pepper Per Unit=$15 , WaterMelloonPerUnit=$(NegativeIntegerMultiplier)(PEPS), Orangeperunit($(NEGATIVEINTEGER-FIVE))And here comes another thing.. This problem needs additional information about negative numbers being allowed within context such when used during division operation resulting into quotients exceeding maximum allowable range hence making them non existant i guess But still lets proceed :- Here goes !!! Firstly Let\u2019s define our parameters:- TCOA=${total cart amount}COTAW={cost of water melons}=TPOW${total people owning wallets}{total units owned}(WPOU)$COLOR=${quantity color}$CONUT=${number unit count},WECS=${weather condition indicator}%{WeatherConditionIndicator%=-(-5)},KHOLR=${Keep Hood Latch Rigged %%=keep hood open rate}&CHILDREN=${childrens age}-[Summarizing Knowledge obtained above & applying formulas while keeping certain conditions taken care off ]$Conversion Factor ${CCF}=|[(TCP)/($TCWT)|=\\frac{[(LWP)&$(C&CL)]-\\[(kho&&children)|]{SUMMARY}|\\\\{\\\\because {summing up knowledge}\\\\}}$Here CCF denotes conversion factor calculated based upon available data points mentioned earlier$-So taking known info aside:-For example-$Data Point One:{TPOINTS}$$= |[\\text{(TPONE)}={\\color{",
        " up (x+20) cents to get one fruit, which means ten fruits like melon would take up 3x + 200 cents per hundredth unit/fruit=three times price of Melons minus twentycents/hundred(or fifteen*four)=five forty dollar . Adding them all together ,Dillion pays four ($one)+twenty($fifteen)*two+$elevendollars$zero$(their equivalent decimal form). Totaling these sums amounts $\\boxed{fiftysix}$ dollars.. ",
        ") plus another half minus fifth so about 18 bucks ($3*5). Therefore; one orange equals around nineteen and seventy cents which means fourteen and fifty cents since we divide both sides by ten. Four melons mean thirty six pounds twenty one thousand seven hundred eightytyeight and fifteen hundreds forty dollars because I multiplied eighteen billion dollar by four Which brings us to sixty eight billion forty nine thousands dollars. And Twenty Peppers multiply Thirteen billions twelve thousand hours would equal Two point Three Billion Seventeen Hundred Eighteen thousand Six hundred Ninety Nine dollars while Ten Oranges Multiply One Point Forty Seven million Three thousand Sixty nought dollars . To sum up everything...Two Million FIVE Hundred Thirty Seven million three hundred eighty six thousandninetyNine Fifty One KiloDollars!That comes out to almost....US$537M , not quite but close!! "
