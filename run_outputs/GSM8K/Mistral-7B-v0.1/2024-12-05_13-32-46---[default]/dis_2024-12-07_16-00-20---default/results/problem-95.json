        "% (which equals 200*2/5) are boys; so that leaves us with 60% or 120 (which equals 200*3/5) being girls. Since 2/3 out of these girls are Girl Scouts which totals up to about 80 kids (because 120*(2/3)=80). Therefore, since we know only half of them joined their classmates into one group that accounts to 40(kids), this means remaining female student who didn't join would amount as below: [Total Female Students] \u2013 ([Girls that belong among Girls\u2019 Troop])= [Female Nonmember]. Thus using above values here it goes like  \u200b[Remaining Females]: [(total females)-80]=40 Remainder! . Hence answering your question I deduce you want all non members amongst FEMALE gender, resulting me with no further complications other than my previous conclusion regarding male ones.\r",

        "scouts (or approximately 5). Therefore the remaining percentage who are NOT Girl Scouts would account to about 4%. That means roughly around **(approximately)** ~2 ((0.04*100)/1=4; consequently 100-(7+4)=96 divided furtherly by average weight among classrooms which i presume as being around twenty kids per group hence forty grade schoolers equate four groups making it eighty.) Hence we know every student belongs either to one club other than 'GirlScouts', three clubs including \u2018girls\u2019 itself OR none meaning nobody actually exists outside these particular categories! However our problem specifically asks only considering those within just 'two distinct social circles'.

However I don\u2019t want to make assumptions regarding \u201cwomen\u201d as all female students are likely represented here so my suggestion can best remain unaddressed without further information.
