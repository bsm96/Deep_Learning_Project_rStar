From condition 1, we can see that 28 - Brooke's age = 2x (Seth's age). From condition 2, we know that Seth is older than Brooke. This means that Seth's age is greater than Brooke's age. From condition 3, we know that in two years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So let's start by finding the current age of Brooke. Since Seth is older than Brooke, we know that Seth's age is greater than Brooke's age. This means that we can subtract Brooke's age from 28, and divide the result by 2. That is, we can solve for Brooke's age using the equation 28 - Brooke's age = 2x (Seth's age). Solving for Brooke's age, we get Brooke's age = 28 - 2x (Seth's age). Substituting this into the condition 3 equation, we get 2(28 - 2x (Seth's age)) + x (Seth's age) = 28. Simplifying this equation, we get 2(28 - 2x (Seth's age)) + x (Seth's age) = 28 56 - 4x (Seth's age) + x (Seth's age) = 28 56 = 4x (Seth's age) Divide both sides by 4 to find Seth's age.
