Condition 1 says that Amy makes more friends than Lily. Therefore, Amy has more friends than Lily. Condition 3 tells us the combined total number of friends for Amy and Lily is equal to their individual numbers plus the difference between their friend counts. This means that the combined total number of friends is equal to Amy's friend count plus Lily's friend count minus the difference between them. Using what we know about condition 1, we can say that the combined total number of friends is Amy's friend count plus Lily's friend count minus the difference between Lily's friend count and Amy's friend count. This means that the combined total number of friends is equal to Amy's friend count plus Lily's friend count minus Lily's friend count plus Amy's friend count. This means that the combined total number of friends is equal to two times the Amy's friend count. Therefore, we can say that the combined total number of friends for Amy and Lily is twice as big as Amy's friend count. Now we can use the information from condition 2 to calculate Amy's friend count. We can say that Amy's friend count is half of the combined total number of friends. Therefore, Amy's friend count is equal to half of the total number of friends which is equal to 50 divided by 2, which is 25. This means that Amy's friend count is 25. We can use this information to find out the combined total number of friends. We can say that the combined total number of friends is twice as big as Amy's friend count. Therefore, the combined total number of friends is equal to two times 25, which is 50.

We know that Condition 1 says that Amy makes more friends than Lily. Second, we know that Lily has made 50 friends. Third, we know that Condition 3 says that the combined total number of friends for both Amy and Lily equals the sum of their individual numbers plus the difference between Amy and Lily's friend counts. Let's start with the third condition. This tells us that the combined total number of friends for both Amy and Lily is equal to the sum of their individual numbers plus the difference between them. Since we know Lily has 50 friends, this means that the sum of Amy's friends plus the difference between Amy and Lily's friend counts must also equal 50. Let's start with the first condition. It tells us that Amy makes more friends than Lily, which means that Amy has more friends than Lily. Let's use this information to help us solve for Amy's number of friends. If Amy makes more friends than Lily, then Amy's number of friends must be greater than Lily's number of friends. Therefore, if Amy's number of friends is X, then Lily's number of friends must be less than X. Since we know Lily has 50 friends, this means that Lily's number of friends can only be 50 or less. Now, let's go back to Condition 3 and plug in what we know about Lily's number of friends. This tells us that the sum of Amy's friends plus the difference between Amy and Lily's friend counts must equal 50. Since Lily's number of friends can only be 50 or less, this means that the difference between Amy and Lily's friend counts must be less than or equal to 50. To make sure that this difference is less than or equal to 50, let's set it equal to 50. This means that the sum of Amy's friends plus 50 must equal 50. Solving this equation, we get that Amy's number of friends must be 0. Therefore, the combined total number of friends for both Amy and Lily is 50 + 0 = 50.

This means Amy's number > Lily's number. Condition 2 tells us Lily has made a total of 50 friends. Condition 3 tells us we can find out Amy and Lily's combined friend count by adding together their individual numbers and subtracting the difference between their friend counts. We know that Lily's friend count is 50, so this tells us that Amy's friend count is 50 - (Amy's friend count - Lily's friend count) = 50 - (Amy's friend count - 50). Combining all three conditions into one equation gives us: (Amy's friend count + Lily's friend count) = Amy's friend count + 50 - (Amy's friend count - 50) = 2 * Amy's friend count - (Amy's friend count - 50) = 2 * Amy's friend count - Amy's friend count + 50 = Amy's friend count + 50.
