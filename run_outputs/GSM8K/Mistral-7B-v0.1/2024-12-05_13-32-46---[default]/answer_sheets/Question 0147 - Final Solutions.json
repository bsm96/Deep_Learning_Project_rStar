Firstly, 30 bees left in 6 hours. Secondly, half as many as these 30 returned. Thirdly, double the amount of these 30 left again. Finally, every one of the previous ones entered again. All of this happened in the same 6 hours. Since we know that 30 bees left and half as many came back, then 30/2=15 bees returned. Therefore 15 bees will leave. Next, since 15 bees left and we were told that every one of the previous ones returned, so 30 will come back. At the last round, since 30 bees left and they were all the previous bees that returned, so 60 will enter the hive again. This means that 60 bees will return in the final 6 hours.
