He has 60 potatoes. Peeling a potato takes 90 seconds. Cutting it takes 5 seconds. If we add those times together, it means it takes 90 + 5 = 95 seconds. To calculate how long it would take to cut all the potatoes, we can multiply the number of potatoes by the seconds it takes to cut them. That means we would need 60 x 95, which is 5700 seconds. But that's way too long! We can use a fraction to make this easier to do. If we divide both numbers by 5, we get 1200 seconds, which is a nice, round number. Finally, let's subtract the time spent peeling the potatoes. 1200 - 90 seconds = 1110. The answer is: 1110.", "value": 0.1}, "ost_step": {}, "direct_answer": {"text": "Let's think step by step.
