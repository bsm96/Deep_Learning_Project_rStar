Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. His salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. This means his salary went up by 40%.

The problem states that Adrien's salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's when the problem started.

Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, this means Adrien's salary was 130% of Lylah's salary. Let's assume that Lylah's salary was $100.

As stated earlier, his salary increased by 40% over the course of four years, on top of the 30% it was higher than Lylah's.

Then Adrien's new salary is 130% of Lylah's salary plus the increase of 70%, which is $130 + ($130 * 0.7) = $231.
