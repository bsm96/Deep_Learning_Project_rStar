We know she can run 4 times faster than walk. That means when she runs 4 miles, she walks 1 mile. Let's say she walks 1 mile per hour. Then we can calculate her running speed. When she runs 1 mile per hour she also covers 4 miles. So we have 1/4 mile per hour for running. We want her skipping speed too. She skips half as fast as she runs. So her skipping speed is 1/8 mile per hour. In six hours she spends one third time running and two thirds time walking. Let's see how far she goes while running. While running she will cover 1 mile every 1/4 hour. So while spending one third time running she will cover (1/3) / (1/4) = (1/3) * (4/1) = 4/3 miles. This leaves 2/3 of the time. During this 2/3 of the time she will cover 1 mile every hour. So she will cover (2/3) * 6 = 4 miles. Adding both together we get 4/3 + 4 = 16/3 miles covered in 6 hours. The answer is: 16/3.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
