Firstly, we know the price of one chicken meal was $12, 5 packs of milk were $3 each, 4 apples were $1.50 each, and one pizza box was $8.50. The problem says she paid a total of $50. Therefore, the amount of pizzas must be 50 - 12 - (5*3) - (4*1.50). Since 50 - 12 - (5*3) - (4*1.50) = 2.5, then she only ordered 2 boxes of pizza.

Then she also got 4 apples, each costing $1.50. Lastly, she got several boxes of pizza. Each box costed $8.50. Altogether, they costed $50.\nTo figure out the amount of pizza boxes, we need to find the amount of money spent on them. We can add up the amounts we know: 12 + 5 * 3 + 4 * 1.50 = 29.50. This means we still need to pay 50 - 29.50 = 20.50 dollars. Dividing this by 8.50 gives us 2.42 pizza boxes. But this doesn't make sense since pizza boxes aren't fractional.
