First, we need to figure out how many crabs Rani has. To do that, we have to find the difference between how many crabs she has and how many Monic has. We know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. So we can subtract 4 from Bo's total to get Monic's total. Then we add 10 to Monic's total to get Rani's total. Now we can add Rani's total and Bo's total together. That will be the total for the three of them.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can write down all the numbers. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic. So we know Monic has <Monic>, and Rani has <Rani>. We also know Bo has 40 crabs, and Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. So Monic's total is <Bo minus 4>.\n\nNow, we can put everything together. Bo's total is 40. We subtract 4 to get Monic's total, so we have <Bo minus 4>. Then we add 10 to that to get Rani's total. So Rani's total is <Monic plus 10>. Finally, we add the three totals together to get the total for the three of them. So the total for the three of them is <Bo plus Monic plus Rani>.\n\nNow, we need to plug in the numbers. Remember, Bo has 40 crabs, Monic has <Monic>, and Rani has <Rani>. So <Monic> is 40 minus 4, which is 36. And <Rani> is 36 plus 10, which is 46. So the total for the three of them is 40 plus 36 plus 46, which is 122. The answer is: 122.", "value": 0.15625}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
