And 1 action figure costs 5. One doll cost as much as 3 action figures and one red car. That means a doll also costs 5. Let's add up the prices of everything to get their total value. For the red cars we have 5 * 4 = 20 dollars. Then for the 3 action figures we have 3 * 5 = 15 dollars. Finally for the doll we have 5 dollars. Adding them all together we get 20 + 15 + 5 = 40.
