To get the number of apples, subtract 8 oranges from the total fruit count. So, Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges means she brought (5 + 8) = 13 fruits in total.", "2": "Since Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, he brought 2*5 = 10 apples.", "3": "To calculate the number of oranges Kael brought, we need to know the number of oranges Morisette brought.
