If he drives at constant speed u, he will reach home in t=(x)/(u). If instead he drives at a constant acceleration a, we have t=sqrt((2x)/(a)). Using this, we find out what value of u or a would result in t=4. For u we have 4*u=x, which results in u=x/4. For a we have 4=sqrt(2x/a), which yields a=2x/4=x/2. Since the actual distance traveled from starting point to home x is greater than 60*3, but less than 80*4, we know that u=x/4<60 and a=x/2>80. Thus, he needs a higher speed to get home faster. But since x cannot exceed 60*3 or 80*4, we know that u=60, which works.
