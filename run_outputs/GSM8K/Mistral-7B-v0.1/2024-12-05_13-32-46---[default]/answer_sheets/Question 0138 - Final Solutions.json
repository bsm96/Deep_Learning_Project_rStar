Firstly, we calculate how long it takes for mark to complete the test with 75 questions. According to the hint, that is (8 hours / 5 questions per hour) = 1.6 hours. Similarly, we calculate how long it takes for him to complete the test with 100 questions. That is (6 hours / 5 questions per hour) = 1.2 hours. Now, we subtract these times. 1.6 - 1.2 is 0.4. So he finished 0.4 hours late. The amount of unfinished questions can be calculated by dividing 0.4 by 1.6. 0.4 / 1.6 = 0.25. So he left 25% of the questions unfinished.
