Josh spent $80,000 + 50,000 = $130,000 on buying the house and repairs. The house became worth 150% more after this. That means the new value of the house is 1.5 times the original value, which was $80,000. This equals 80,000 * 1.5 = 120,000. If Josh sold the house for 120,000, he would break even.
