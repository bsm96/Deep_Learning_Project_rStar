First we find the increment Sylvie gets when she completed 5 years. It would be 10% of 600 which is 60 dollars. So after 5 years, she was getting 600 + 60 = 660 dollars as her annual salary. Now, if she completes another 3 years, it means she is completing the 8th year. 10% of 660 dollars would mean a 66 dollar increase making her get a salary of 660 + 66 = 726 dollars per annum.
