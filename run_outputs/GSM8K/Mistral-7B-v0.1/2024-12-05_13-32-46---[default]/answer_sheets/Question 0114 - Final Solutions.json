According to the problem, there are 6 times more pictures on Jamal's phone than on Brittany's phone.  Therefore, if Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, Brittany's phone holds 1800/6 = 300 photographs.  Now we know that the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.  50 times the number of ducks would equal 300 (the maximum number of photos Brittany's phone could hold).
