If he chooses jewelry worth 5,000 dollars, it will go up by 2.5%. 5,000 x 1.025 = 5,125. If he chooses electronic gadgets, they will go up 1.2%. 8,000 x 1.012 = 8,096. So the jewelry plan will bring him 5,125 - 5,000 = 125 dollars of extra profit, but the electronic gadgets plan will only bring 8,096 - 8,000 = 96 dollars.
