By condition 1, 1 / 20 of the 2 liters of water enters the boat. That is, 1 / 20 of the 2 liters of water is equal to 1 liter of water. So one foot equals 1 / 20 of the 20 feet rowing, which equals 1 liter of water. By condition 2, it takes Julia 1 second to row 20 feet. Then 1 second equals 20 feet, which equals 1 liter of water.
