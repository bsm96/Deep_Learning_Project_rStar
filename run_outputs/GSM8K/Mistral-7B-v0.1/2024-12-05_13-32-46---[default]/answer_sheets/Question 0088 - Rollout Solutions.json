We can say 10 * harald's = marilyn's. Since we don't know how many copies harald sold, let's call it 'x'. So, 10 * x = marilyn's. Now we just need to figure out what marilyn's equals to. Let's call it 'y'. That means 10 * x = y. Let's turn this equation around to solve for 'x'. x = y/10. The answer is: y/10.", "value": 0.6}, "ost_step": {"1": "Now we just need to substitute the values into our equation to get our final answer. We know that they sold 88,000 copies combined. So, marilyn's must equal 88,000. And we calculated that harald's equals 88,000 / 10 or 8,800. So, Harald sold 8,800 copies.", "2": "The answer is 8,800.", "3": "Great! I hope this helps!
