We know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more than that. And we also know that the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 300. 50 times more than the number of birds in the photograph is 50 * 6 = 300. So the number of birds in the photograph must be 300/50 = 6. Next, we know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. Therefore, if Brittany's phone can hold 300 photos, Jamal's phone can hold 6 * 300 = 1800 photos.
