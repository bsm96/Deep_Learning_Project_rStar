The bag has 5 servings. And one serving weighs 300/5 = 60 g. We need to find out how much grams we can eat while staying within our daily calorie target of 2000. Our daily target is 2000. We have eaten 1800 calories. That leaves us 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories remaining. So let's try to figure out how many grams of chips we can eat while consuming no more than 200 calories. Since we want 200 calories or fewer, we'll multiply 250 calories per serving times 1 or less. 250 x 1 = 250. 250 is less than 200, so we can safely eat up to 250 calories worth of chips. How much does that translate to in terms of grams? Each serving weighs 60 grams. So if we want to eat 250 calories, we can eat 250/60 = 4.1666... servings. The closest value lower than this is 4 servings. That means we could eat 4 servings of chips. Since each serving is 60 grams, 4 servings is 4 * 60 = 240 grams.
