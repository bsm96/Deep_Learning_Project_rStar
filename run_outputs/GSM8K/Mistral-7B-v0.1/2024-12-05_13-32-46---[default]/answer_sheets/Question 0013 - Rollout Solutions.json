That means Melanie had 5 + 5 = 10 vacuum cleaners to begin with. Half of these were sold at the orange house. Since there were 10, this would be 10 / 2 = 5 vacuum cleaners. At the red house, Melanie sold 2 more than this, so she sold 7 vacuum cleaners. The green house had a third of her starting amount, which is 10 / 3 = 3.33... She only sold 3 of these, so 10 - 3 = 7 vacuum cleaners were sold at the green house. 10 - 7 = 3 vacuum cleaners were left over. The answer is: 10.", "value": 0.125}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
