Let's assume that Lee can run the 400-meter hurdles in 30 seconds before changing his diet. Since he was two seconds faster than Gerald, Gerald can also run it in 32 seconds. His new speed is 1.1 times of that before the diet change. Therefore, his new speed for running 400-meter hurdles is 1.1 * 32 = 35.2 seconds.
