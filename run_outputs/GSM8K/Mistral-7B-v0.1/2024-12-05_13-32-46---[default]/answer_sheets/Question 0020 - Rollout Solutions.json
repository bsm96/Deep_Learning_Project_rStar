The problem states there is 10 liters of orange drink."}, "direct_answer": {"text": "There was 10 liters of orange drink originally. We can use this to find the amount of water mixed into the orange drink. Since it is two thirds of the orange drink, we can calculate this by using the formula 10/3=7. So there are 7 liters of water. We can also find how much pineapple drink there is by subtracting the amount of orange drink (10) from the amount of pineapple drink (15). Therefore, there is 5 liters of pineapple drink. To get the final amount of water, you multiply the amount of pineapple drink (5) by its fractional part (three fifths), which will equal to 3. So there is a total of 3+7 or 10 liters of water. The answer is: 10 liters of water.", "value": 0.09375}}}, "rollout_id": 1}]
