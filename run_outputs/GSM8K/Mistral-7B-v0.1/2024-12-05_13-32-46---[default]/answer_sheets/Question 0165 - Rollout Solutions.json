From this, she buys the computer which costs 1090\u20ac. So the difference between 1500\u20ac and 1090\u20ac is 410\u20ac. She also buys the screen, keyboard, and mouse, which cost 157\u20ac+74\u20ac+102\u20ac=333\u20ac. So the remaining money is 410\u20ac - 333\u20ac = 77\u20ac. She has 77\u20ac left.
