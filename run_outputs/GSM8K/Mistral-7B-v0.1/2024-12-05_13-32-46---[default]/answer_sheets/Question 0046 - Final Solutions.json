Condition 2 says that she stopped by a store on the way and purchased a package of post-it notes. We don't know how many post-it notes were in the package, but we know that it was greater than zero because otherwise the condition would not be true (there would be no point in stopping by if you couldn't get any!). Condition 3 states that she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 cups of coffee. This means that she used 220 post-it notes in total. Condition 4 tells us that she ended up with 23 post-it notes remaining overall. We can subtract the 220 used from the original 80 in Candice's purse to find out how many were originally in the package: 80 - 220 = -140. But since there can't be negative numbers of post-it notes, this answer is wrong. To make this sum correct, we need to add the remaining 23 to the original 80 to get: 80 + 23 = 103.
