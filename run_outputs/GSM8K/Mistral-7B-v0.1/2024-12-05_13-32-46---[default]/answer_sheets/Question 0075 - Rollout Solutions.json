To do this, we need to add up all the levels. We know that there are four levels. Each level has half the square footage of the level below it. So, let's start with the last level. It has a square footage of 16. Then, the level below it would be 8, then 4, then 2. So, the total square footage for all levels combined would be 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30.", "2": "Divide the total square footage by the number of levels.

To find out the area of the second level, we need to divide the top level's area by 2 because we want to get the level below it. That would mean we want to halve the first number. The answer is 8. To find out the area of the third level, we can repeat the above step. That would be 8 / 2 = 4. Finally, we can do the same thing to find out the area of the fourth level, which is 4 / 2 = 2.
