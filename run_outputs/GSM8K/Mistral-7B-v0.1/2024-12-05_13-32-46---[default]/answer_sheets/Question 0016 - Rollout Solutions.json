We know they both started traveling at the same time and that they both traveled for 80 miles. So, each train traveled 80 miles during this part of the journey.", "2": "Next, we need to calculate how far the trains traveled on their journey northwards. We know that they both traveled for one day, so we need to multiply the number of miles per hour they traveled by the number of hours they traveled. Let's assume that they both traveled at 30 mph.
