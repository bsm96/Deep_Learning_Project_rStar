One year ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age. That means that one year ago, Mark was 5 years older than Jan's current age divided by 2.\nSince it is said that Mark is 5 years older than Jan's current age divided by 2, we can write the following equation:\nMark = (Jan / 2) + 5\n\nNow let's substitute values for the variables. We know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. So we have to subtract 2 years from both sides of our equation. This gives us the following equation:\n(Mark - 2) = (Jan / 2) - 2\n\nSince Mark is two years older than Jan, we know that Mark equals Jan plus 2. We can therefore substitute this into our equation. This gives us:\n(Jan + 2 - 2) = (Jan / 2) - 2\n\nSimplifying our equation, we get:\nJan = (Jan / 2) - 2\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2, we get:\n2*Jan = Jan\n\nSubtracting Jan from both sides, we get:\nJan = 0\n\nFrom this, we know that when Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, Jan's age was 0. Since we also know that Mark was 2 years older than Jan, we can conclude that when Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age, Jean was 2 years older than 0, which is 2.
