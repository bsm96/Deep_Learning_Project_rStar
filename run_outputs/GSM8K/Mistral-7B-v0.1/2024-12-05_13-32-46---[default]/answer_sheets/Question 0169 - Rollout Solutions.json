This means that the total number of miles walked during the week is 20 * 5 days in the week = 100 miles. Since his walking distance drops to 10 miles during the weekend, this means that the total number of miles walked during the weekend is 2 * 2 days in the weekend = 20 miles. Thus, the total number of miles walked in a typical week is 100 + 20 = 120. The answer is: 120.", "value": 0.46875}}}, "rollout_id": 0}, {"trace": {"0": {"user_question": "Pancho walks 20 miles a day. Except on weekends when he walks 10 miles.
