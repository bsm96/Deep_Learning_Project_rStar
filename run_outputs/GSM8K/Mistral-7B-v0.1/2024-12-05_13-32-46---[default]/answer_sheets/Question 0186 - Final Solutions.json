So each rat gets 6 / 3 = 2 pieces of straw. Let's call this quantity of straw B. We can calculate that there are 160 - (A + B) = 60 pieces of straw for the rabbits. We need to find out how many pieces of straw there are per rat in each group.\n\nSo we have 160 - (A + B) = 60. This means A + B = 100. And B / 3 = 2.
