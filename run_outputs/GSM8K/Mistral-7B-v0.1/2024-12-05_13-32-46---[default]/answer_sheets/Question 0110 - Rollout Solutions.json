Marcell's roll-up is 14 rolls long. It is also 3 rolls wide. This means he has 14 x 3 = 42 roll-ups. Since Marcell and Beatrice both ate all their roll-ups, we add the lengths together and divide by the number of roll-ups. We add 48 + 42 = 90. We then divide by 2, since there are 2 of them. 90 / 2 is 45.
