He sells each lego set for 15 dollars. So he sold 13 * 15 = 195.\nAfter selling the lego sets, he has 8 video games at a cost of 20 each. So the cost of these 8 video games is 8 * 20 = 160. This is deducted from the money he earned by selling the lego sets, which leaves him with 195 - 160 = 35 dollars.\nWith these 35 dollars, he purchased 5 video games at a cost of 5 dollars each. This leaves him with 35 - (5*5) = 15 dollars. With this, he has 5 lego sets remaining.
