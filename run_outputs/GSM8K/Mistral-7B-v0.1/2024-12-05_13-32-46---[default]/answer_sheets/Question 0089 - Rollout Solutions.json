Christina invited 16 friends. 1/4 of them won't show up, which is 16 * (1 / 4) = 4 people who won't come. So she should buy .75 gift bags per 12 friends. That is 12 * .75 = 9 gift bags.

First, let's calculate the number of people who will attend. 16 guests are invited, and 1/4 usually don't show up. So, we multiply 16 by 3/4, which equals 12. So 12 people will actually come. Then, according to condition 3, 3/4 of a gift bag is needed for every invited person because \u00bc won\u2019t show up. So, we multiply 12 by 3/4, which equals 9.
